# About Me

I'm a software engineer. In my free time I write [code][port], a [blog][blog],
[fiction][fiction], and [build a programming language][austral].

[port]: /portfolio/
[austral]: https://github.com/austral/austral
[blog]: /article/
[fiction]: /fiction/
[gh]: https://github.com/eudoxia0

I have too many interests to list exhaustively, but this is a representative
sample of how I spend my time:

1. Software engineering, theory and practice. Compilers, programming languages,
   type systems, parsers; not abstractly but with the goal of improving
   engineering practices.
1. Data modeling, ontologies, logic, information management: choosing the right
   formalisms to model the world.
1. Self-improvement: autodidactism, lifting, productivity, time-tracking.
1. The future: what does life look like after biology, and what does the
   universe look like after intelligence?

If this is interesting to you, [send me an email][mail].
