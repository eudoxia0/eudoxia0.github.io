I'm available for consulting work.

# Skills

- **Formalization:** I enjoy the process of taking vague, abstract product
  design ideas and formalizing them into a concrete software object.
- **Rust:** love it, and use it for most personal projects. I can build
  greenfield projects, migrate existing services, or teach it to your team.
- **SQL:** I've done a lot of work on optimizing query performance without
  sacrificing normalization; and migrating messy schemas to clean, normalized
  designs.
- **Compilers:** parsers, compilers, and DSLs. If you need a bespoke programming
  language, or language tooling, or you need to migrate data from an inscrutable
  legacy format, I can help.
- **APIs:** I've spent most of my career building backend web services, so I
  have a lot of experience with designing and implementing REST APIs and SQL
  schemas.

# Traits

- **Low Latency:** I take a lot of pride in replying to things fast.
- **Polyglot:** I am not a "Python programmer" or a "functional programmer", or
  a partisan for a particular tech stack. I like learning new languages and
  tools and I make technical decisions dispassionately.
- **Literate:** I'm a great technical writer. I can write terse, rigorous prose
  to help you make hard technical decisions, or to help onboard new people.

# Services

- **Implementation:** I build your software, from prototype to production.
- **Research:** you have a technical question you want an answer to.
- **Training:** I teach your team about Rust, SQL, functional programming, etc.
- **Compliance:** your clients want to know your systems are secure. I can help
  with SOC2 certification, both on the technical side and the business policy
  side, from zero to audit.
