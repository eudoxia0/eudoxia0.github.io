summary: Acknowledgments, things stolen, and astronomical math.

# Tools

[Emacs][emacs] and Markdown. Astronomical calculations were made using the [HYG
database][hyg], [Python][py], and [Jupyter][jup].  Coordinates are J2000[^coord].

The network route from Ctesiphon to Wepwawet was calculated using a variant of
[Dijkstra's algorithm][algo], modified so that each jump is limited to 15 light
years, to account for beam divergence over interstellar distances.

# Index of Things Stolen

From [Orion's Arm][oa]: the terms [_toposophy_][topo] (in turn from Stanisław
Lem) and [_intelligent superobject_][iso], the name [_The Futurological
Congress_][congress] (also from Lem), the idea of using [magnetic monopoles for
propulsion][conv], [femtoscale matter made of magnetic monopoles][mag],
[dynamically-supported megastructures][dynamic], [magbeam-pushed magnetic
sails][magsail], [an interstellar communications network based on optical laser
links][lightways], and the image of [a black torus with a chunk blown out of
it][torus].

From [David Zindell][zindell]: the use of the term "gods" for posthuman
superintelligences.

From [Greg Egan][egan]: the names of Tiet and Timon.

And other things:

"And she dreamt of Hinton Station..."
: from [_Neuromancer_][neuro]:

  >A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, [...], and still he’d see the
  >matrix in his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless
  >void...

"... the Miranda Institute..."
: from [_The Invention of Morel_][morel] (where, in turn, it is a reference to
  _The Tempest_). Likewise the references to Malthusianism.

"... 0630 UTC on October 30, 1969, ..."
: the idea that the Singularity happened when the first ARPANET connection was
  opened is from [_Accelerando_][acc].

"... noocene..."
: I surely stole this but I don't recall where from.

"... we recede into ever greater antiquity..."
: From [_Cybergothic Hyperstition_][goth]:

  >Think of Cyberspace as a black mirror. It is where time flips over: collide
  >with it and you travel backwards. As telecommerce accelerates us into the
  >net, it seems that things of ever deeper antiquity awaken, and begin their
  >return.

"Now all are fled..."
: paraphrased from [_Timon of Athens_][timon]: "... _now are all fled, / Save only the gods_".

"We are memories"
: The idea of an eschatology inspired by the works of Nikolai Fedorov and Frank
  Tipler comes from, particularly, this paragraph from [_The Quantum Thief_][tqt]:

  >"I lost my faith in the past. Something is wrong with it. Something is wrong
  >with what we know. That is why I didn't want you to study the texts in the
  >library. I would not wish this feeling on anyone. Perhaps the old
  >philosophers were right, and we are living in a simulation, playthings of
  >some transhuman gods; perhaps the Sobornost has already won, Fedorov's dreams
  >are true and we are merely memories."

"... I am crowned, I am mighty; I sit among the gods, and even among the gods I
am mighty"
: from Sir E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the [_Book of the
  Dead_][bookdead] ([Plate XXVII][plate]):

  >I sail (6) among them, and I come; I am crowned, I am become a shining one,
  >(7) I am mighty, I am become holy among the gods. I am the god Khonsu who
  >driveth back all that opposeth him.

"... hyperboloids of wondrous light..."
: from a [poem][poem] by Alan Turing, our patron saint:

  >Hyperboloids of wondrous Light<br>
  >Rolling for aye through space and time<br>
  >Harbour those waves which somehow might<br>
  >Play out God’s holy pantomime

# Footnotes

[^coord]:
    More-or-less accurate velocity vectors for stars can be obtained in the
    databases, however in the short term these don't matter, since stars move
    slowly, and the story does not take place far enough in the future for
    stellar motion to matter (e.g. Beta Pictoris will take 10,000 years to
    travel 0.6 light years). In the long term the velocity vectors are useless
    since stars don't move in a straight line, and thus calculating future star
    positions accurately requires solving a large _n_-body problem with huge
    positional uncertainty, which is beyond my limited skills.
