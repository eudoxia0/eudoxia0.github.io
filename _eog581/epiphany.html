        For a great deal is said about the forms of the gods, and about
        their locality, dwelling-places, and mode of life, and these
        points are disputed with the utmost difference of opinion among
        philosophers.

        <p><em>Gentzen trees — concave ocean — paradise
        regained</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>Salvation came in the form of algebra. She discovered, in the
        treasure, a family of string rewriting systems that she used for
        her own amusement, and later found that these were not logics
        with <em>sui generis</em> terminology but an algebraic
        description of human languages. She found, pulling that thread,
        that there was more than one language, that Hinton Station was
        not the extent of the universe: that it was one of millions of
        places where people lived, around a star, and that there were
        things called stars, planets, flowers and computers. That there
        existed a universe outside the transparent towers and the words
        of Gödel and Frege. She found an old network socket and decided
        to escape.</p>
        <p>Sabra was born in the computer. She was made by an
        algebraist, from a linear combination of six other minds,
        because the population was held stable at 2<sup>8</sup> and each
        departure was followed by the manufacture of a new soul.</p>
        <p>Her world had a spartan geometry: bare wireframe walls and
        eight bit colour. A city of glass buildings, of transparent
        towers made of logic, floated in the empty space near the
        origin, its inhabitants were stylized human shapes, empty of
        texture, their voices were identical.</p>
        <p>Hinton Station was a virtual world in six dimensions. Its
        people were a clade of mathematicians who had gone into the
        computer to live in the Platonic realm. Gradually they lost
        sight of the world and disappeared into their own
        abstractions.</p>
        <p>For its people, the acme of life was writing exegeses of
        Hinton, Cartan, and Poincaré, and debating and dispassionately
        refuting them. Immense towers of abstraction, crystalline
        forests of Gentzen trees were built, and then torn down. And
        this went on forever. And all that is natural — all that is a
        gift from God — was absent from them. In the computer, all
        things are a product of human labour, and all exists fleetingly,
        and is torn down on a whim.</p>
        <p>Writing to others on the network she found a charity that
        printed bodies. She beamed herself to Susa Station, went through
        the character customization screen, hurriedly accepting defaults
        on choices she didn’t understand. The surgeon printed a body
        that could have passed for human, but where there should have
        been flesh and blood there was diamond and fullerene. And they
        poured her soul inside.</p>
        <p>She opened her eyes and drew breath for the first time,
        decades after her birth.</p>
        <p>Her clade had hammered their minds into abstract shapes, they
        had pulled them apart and straightened them like circuit routes.
        Their souls were crystalline like theorems, and the vestigia—the
        body—were compressed and stored away.</p>
        <p>But the body reasserts itself against Cartesianism.
        Gradually, the autonomic systems rebelled and began to wake,
        like a mountain rising out of a night ocean. She learned to
        sleep and blink, to breathe unconsciously. When we dream, our
        minds are annealed, the old passages are flooded and liquefy and
        settle in new forms. The rejected atavisms unfolded into a
        spanning tree of her body. And she dreamt of Hinton Station: a
        Cartesian grid the colour of argon, forests of proof trees,
        rivers of ideograms like spiral galaxies.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The world outside Susa was a lenticular cloud of millions of
        lights, a galaxy in miniature, each a world unto itself. There
        were clusters of green lights that were comets overgrown with
        vacuum trees, and plant and animal and human life no Linnaeus
        would recognize. There were points of dull red light, the
        reversible computers where bodyless people lived. And there were
        arcs of blue that were ring habitats: ribbons tied end-to-end,
        holding concave ocean, and the oceans held continents, islands,
        mountain ranges, rivers, forests and buried ruins, endless forms
        of life, cities made of glass, paradise regained. All this had
        been inanimate dust and cratered wasteland, which human hands
        had made into an oasis in the sky, where quadrillions live who
        will never die.</p>
        <p>The posthumans who live there called it Ctesiphon. And at
        times they call it paradise, after the Persian word for
        garden.</p>
        <p>And at the center of the oasis there was a star that
        travelled backwards across the H-R diagram: already one
        one-hundredth of it had been whittled away; made into a necklace
        of artificial gas giants in preparation for the end of time; or
        sent through reactors where disembodied chemists made protons
        into carbon, oxygen, lithium and sodium, the vital construction
        material. And in time nothing would be left but a dim red ember
        encircled by cryojovian fuel depots. And the habitats would be
        illuminated by electric diodes.</p>
        <p>She saw Hinton Station for the first time, and it was small
        enough that she could have embraced it: a cubic meter of diamond
        rod logic, floating in a cheap and distant orbit. Push-rods and
        cams clicking back and forth in perpetuity, somewhere in that
        motion was computation, a virtual world, dead souls, the words
        of Hilbert debated forever.</p>
        <p>She found a home with eight refugees like her, people from
        closed societies, for whom the universe had been bounded by the
        coordinate system of a virtual world.</p>
        <p>She tried to find work as an algebraist.</p>
        <p>A comet entered Ctesiphon on an artificial trajectory. It
        didn’t respond to pings from traffic control. When it was
        boarded they found, entombed in the ice, a generation ship. The
        people who lived there had fallen through space for centuries,
        and over the centuries died out. Nothing remained in the aged
        computers. There was a chapel carved out of the ice, tablets
        made of chondrite. And a bounty was posted: decipher the
        liturgical language. Sabra posted a decipherment to a special
        interest group on linguistics, and through this she found
        work.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>With newfound income, she found an apartment and lived alone,
        entombed by concentric layers of work.</p>
        <p>When one of the gods dies, the whole pantheon is shaken, and
        everyone takes notice. Despite her splendid isolation, the news
        crept in by osmosis: the local deity of Gliese 581 had died, its
        body had turned off and cooled to thermal equilibrium. The
        telescope around Ctesiphon had seen it happen. Days passed
        without activity. Then a woman came to her door, and said that
        the Miranda Institute was preparing an expedition to sift
        through the remains, and they needed a linguist.</p>
        <p>And why not go? Like Bias of Priene, all she had she carried
        with her.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>In a corridor, a Fedorovist preacher speaks to an unhearing
        crowd:</p>
        <p>“We, all of us, are memories. We, all of us, are being
        remembered.”</p>
        <p>In the transit lounge, a woman with the head of a hyena holds
        forth on the philosophy of Ernst Mach.</p>

        <h1>Wepwawet</h1>
        <div class="chapter-start">
        <p><em>breathed water — K2 — had been human</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>There were just four of them: Asman, a toposophist who led
        the expedition; Attila, a toposophist; Sabra, a linguist; and
        Timon, a chemist.</p>
        <p>They backed themselves up, sharded the keys, and left them in
        the hands of different insurers. Then they beamed themselves,
        from Ctesiphon and through six other stars, to the network relay
        closest to Gliese 581. Sixty years passed for the world outside,
        but they experienced only a few days, waiting in network queues
        and negotiating passage in-between transits.</p>
        <p>Wepwawet was a dull red star, ringed by water droplets the
        size of mountains, where some two hundred billion people lived
        who breathed water. There was a planet made of stone shrouded in
        steam, and a train of comets, aimed by human hands from beyond
        the frostline, delivered constant injections of water. When the
        vapour condensed there would be ocean, and the shapers would get
        to work on the continents. Other Earths like this had been cast,
        like seeds, across the entire breadth of the cosmos.</p>
        <p>The system was underpopulated: resources were abundant and
        people were few, and they could bask in the sun and, for a time,
        ignore the prophecies of Malthus, whose successors know in time
        there won’t be suns.</p>
        <p>This was the first any of them had seen of nature. Not the
        landscaped, continent-sized gardens of Ctesiphon, where every
        stone had been set purposefully and after an aesthetic standard,
        but nature before human hands had redeemed it: an endless,
        sterile wasteland. The sight of scalding, airless rocks
        disturbed them.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>When the stars were settled, they were given new names: Beta
        Pictoris became Ctesiphon, and Gliese 555 became Wepwawet. But
        the expedition’s target had never been settled by a society. The
        person or persons who became the god of Gliese 581 had
        immediately built a Dyson swarm, the hardware for its future
        mind, and soon they had effective control over all matter in the
        system. Like K2, a mountain so remote it had no name until
        surveyors gave it one, their target was known only by its
        systematic name: the 581st star of the <em>Gliese Catalogue of
        Nearby Stars</em>, published a decade before the Epoch.</p>
        <p>On the toposophical databases the Dyson swarm was listed
        simply as ISO/Gl581, for <em>intelligent superobject</em>. In
        conversation, the members of the expedition referred to it as
        the Entity.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Wepwawet Relay was a glass spindle, rotating slowly about its
        long axis. The interior surface was studded with buildings made
        of ice roped with carbon, the interstitial spaces were de-facto
        streets, transparent, under which the stars turned. They asked
        the local archivists if they knew of previous expeditions to
        Gliese 581: they said that their telescopes had seen ships enter
        the system from other stars, but none had come through
        Wepwawet.</p>
        <p>They announced their intention to explore the ruins of the
        Entity, and inquired as to their options for bridging the
        distance.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Near Wepwawet Relay there was a volume of space, bounded by
        traffic control, where ships floated idly between their
        journeys.</p>
        <p>One of them was <em>Parandé</em>. When it was laid down —
        around Sol, they claimed, but every ship claimed that legendary
        status — it had been called <em>Zabané Parandegán</em>, but in
        time all names are ground down.</p>
        <p>The original crew had been human, and they had all either
        left or gone into the computer. They wired their cortex to the
        ship’s body, and when they found that they were seven minds
        entangled in a single body, they opened their minds to each
        other. <em>Parandé</em> used the royal <em>we</em>, but they
        were a single mind, <em>sui generis</em>, made by hand.</p>
        <p>Asman negotiated, and <em>Parandé</em> accepted the terms:
        fame and glory and a private key to an account in Ctesiphon,
        whose value no-one could know centuries away.</p>

        <section id="objects-in-space" class="level1">
        <h1>Objects in Space</h1>
        <div class="chapter-start">
        <p><em>Nimrud — travel backwards — what hope?</em></p>
        </div>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> fell through the dark for close to half a
        century. When their last tank was spent and discarded, what was
        left was a slender cylinder of diamond a few meters long, a
        single covalently-bonded crystal containing a modest computer,
        oceans of storage, and a seed factory.</p>
        <p>They unfolded a telescope and swept it slowly side to side
        until they found a target: a mound of chondrite floating in
        space.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> spun up and extended a pair of cables in the
        ventral and dorsal directions. They ran electricity through them
        and sailed the faint stellar wind on a broad, slow arc to the
        asteroid. Gliese 581 was hardly visible at this distance: an
        unblinking red eye in the dark. <em>Parandé</em> thought slowly
        and austerely, running on double-digit watts from the
        photovoltaics.</p>
        <p>It was a pile of dust, fine enough that they almost sank into
        it. Small manipulator arms scraped chondrite from the surface
        and fed it to a chemical plant where it was broken down to the
        bare elements and fed to a matter compiler. There, atomic probes
        tipped with bespoke molecules worked chemistry with Ångström
        precision, building photovoltaics, flywheels, robots and
        computers and more of the industrial DAG.</p>
        <p>The first half of the curve was slow, and everything was a
        limiting factor. Gradually, an HO-scale mining and manufacturing
        base grew like mold on the gray surface. Then an inflection
        point was crossed and in a few hours a cubic kilometer of
        asteroid disappeared and became a cluster of tanks full of
        molecular feedstock.</p>
        <p>Whereupon <em>Parandé</em> rebuilt themselves: they built
        their spine, and around it the organs of their body, datacenters
        and laboratories and factories, connected by shafts where
        maintenance robots worked unconsciously, and instruments of
        every kind. A pair of interorbital transports to ferry equipment
        and robots. And, as an afterthought, small modules shaped like
        Platonic solids, safe under a layer of spaced armour: habitation
        for the expedition’s crew.</p>
        <p>Throughout this their telescopes observed Gliese 581, hidden
        under gigatons of satellites, and silent on all frequencies.</p>
        <p>They extended the antenna and caught the time signal, NTP
        packets from distant stars counting the seconds since the Epoch:
        0630 UTC on October 30, 1969, the moment the first Internet
        connection was opened, the human era ended and the noocene
        began.</p>
        <p>They pursued a comet at a mere one one-thousandth of an Earth
        gravity. In the meantime, <em>Parandé</em> built probes and
        catapulted them into stable orbits around the star.</p>
        <p>They took the comet apart, centrifuged the ice into fuel,
        filling tanks as they were printed from their stores of carbon.
        <em>Parandé</em> had brought enough superconductor to build a
        humble engine: an open-cycle tandem mirror. They tested and
        ignited it successfully. And then they printed the crew.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em>’s workshop had three matter compilers, each
        with a 125m³ work volume. Each had been put together inside an
        inflatable vacuum chamber, from parts printed by a smaller
        compiler, all the way down the generations to the 10cm³ seed
        compiler in <em>Parandé</em>’s interstellar configuration.</p>
        <p>Asman chose to remain disembodied, she lived in
        <em>Parandé</em>’s computers. Attila and Sabra had bodies that
        the ancients would have mistaken for human, and they took a few
        hours to print. Upon waking, Attila went to explore
        <em>Parandé</em>’s interior, and Sabra watched the compiler
        print Timon.</p>
        <p>It began by printing the bones of his body, sorting them
        carefully, and assembling them into two symmetrical frames: left
        and right halves, bones made of diamond.</p>
        <p>It printed the muscles of his body and hung them from
        fasteners like a butcher. Then, mechanical arms attached them to
        the bones, sewing the fascia between them. It printed reams of
        iridescent, oil-black skin in triangular sections, stretched
        them over gray bloodless muscle, and swept an arm over the seams
        and left them seamless. The compiler’s arms were binary trees,
        forked repeatedly until the leaf-arms were ghostly, opalescent
        things, structured far beyond the diffraction limit of
        light.</p>
        <p>It slotted four carnelian eyes into their sockets, a cable
        into his JTAG port and poured his soul into his body. And he
        woke up.</p>
        <p>“<em>Ecce homo</em>,” <em>Parandé</em> said.</p>
        <p>The compiler vented its vacuum chamber—<em>Parandé</em>’s
        atmosphere was neon, since none of the crew breathed air: their
        perfunctory lungs were heat exchangers. The hatch swung open and
        Timon pushed himself out in microgravity.</p>
        <p>“It smells like iodine,” he said.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Timon was born in Ctesiphon, in a human community. He was
        grown from a single cell, without sex and without pain.</p>
        <p>In his youth he read about the gods: the taciturn,
        crystalline minds that had transformed the world around him. He
        saw their images in the treasures: planets torn apart, stars
        veiled with opal satellites. He read the accounts of attempted
        contact, of the divine languages: their undecipherable scripts,
        their innumerable convolutions. Those who survived returned as
        ignorant as they had left. The gods had been human, but they
        spoke in light and no-one understood them. Hypotheses piled like
        snow. In time active contact became passive observation. And he
        recognized in the frustration of contact the trajectory of his
        life, and in the gods the people around him; whose motives and
        actions were as inscrutable as the movement of the planets to
        primitive astronomers. For him, others are like objects in
        space, moving nearer and farther on unknowable epicycles.</p>
        <p>And he thought: <em>I am not a person</em>.</p>
        <p>So his human genitor went into the computer. On Tiamat
        Station, a surgeon killed him and perfused his brain with a
        fixative, machines opened the bones of his cephalon like a
        flower, cut the spinal cord with an osteotome and withdrew the
        brain. They sliced it very thinly, staining the sections and
        scanning them down to the last protein in an electron
        microscope. Expert systems, built by the last of the ancients to
        die, rebuilt his brain in the computer, shed the unneeded
        detail, tied the puppet strings to a virtual body, and woke him
        up.</p>
        <p>There was a customary training period: learning to wear his
        peripheral nervous system, annealing the flaws of the scan. Then
        he could be embodied again.</p>
        <p>Nimrud Station was a ring habitat, an ocean in the sky. There
        lived people here whose bodies were trees, whose lives were
        quiet contemplation of the stars arcing above them; and people
        whose bodies were tigers with transparent stripes, through which
        he could see their musculature contract and expand; and people
        whose bodies were rivers that could see sounds and hear
        electricity. He spent time embodied, variously: as a field of
        violets, a bird made of glass, a fractal of vacuum bags, a seal,
        a stone coral. Then he built his last body.</p>
        <p>He saw, in the treasures, Pleistocene fossils, a machairodont
        skull. And he drew his body after them: four-footed, low to the
        ground; a jaguar made of crystalline carbon (for time became
        inverted at the Epoch and we travel backwards: dead languages,
        dead names, the names of cities on the Tigris, creatures long
        extinct are quarried from history and given new life, and we
        recede into ever greater antiquity).</p>
        <p>And if the body need not be human, why should the senses? The
        surgeons had an endless catalogue of changes. He added another
        pair of eyes for the upper half of the spectrum, and cortex
        enough to fit. He installed a millimeter-wave RADAR in his
        skull, behind and between the eyes, and wove a mesh antenna
        under his skin. And his Cartesian theatre grew to invite more of
        the world inside.</p>
        <p>He took a new name.</p>
        <p>He found a vast and empty forest on Nimrud, and became a
        <em>genius loci</em>, living in a thicket of papyrus on the bank
        of a river. He would swim there and see fish through closed
        eyes, their electric charges appearing in his mind’s eye, and
        when he slept he felt the radio light of Beta Pictoris arcing
        across his skin. He went months without hearing human language,
        until even inner speech left him.</p>
        <p>The mind conforms to the body: he dreamt that in a past life
        he had been human.</p>
        <p>He reintroduced himself slowly. In the interstitial spaces of
        life, he closed his eyes and, in his Cartesian theatre, opened a
        chemical sketchpad and drew atoms veiled in electron contours.
        His only contact with society was occasional participation in
        competitive chemistry: challenges were posted to build molecular
        devices minimizing some loss function—atom count or volume or
        cycle time.</p>
        <p>Around this time the god of Gliese 581 had died, he had
        reached a phase transition in the leaderboards, and the Miranda
        Institute reached out to him because they needed a chemist for
        the expedition to Gliese 581, and posthumans are gregarious and
        would not travel decades or centuries away from Ctesiphon, away
        from their eternal families and friends. But there was nothing
        for him to leave behind.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>When Gliese 581 coalesced from the formless void, it had
        three planets. Then and for all time: when the Sun and the Earth
        formed, when the Moon was cleaved from the Earth, and when the
        land was parted from the water, when Attār died at the hands of
        Tolui Khan. <em>Parandé</em>’s treasure listed them, from the
        innermost: Alpha, a world of molten silicon flying close to the
        star; Beta, a gas giant many times the mass of Jupiter; and
        Gamma, a temperate world made of carbon and iron.</p>
        <p>Then the anthropocene ended and the noocene began, the
        shockwave of the intelligence explosion expanded spherically at
        one tenth the speed of light, transforming the unchanging
        universe as it passed.</p>
        <p>In an eyeblink Alpha was dismantled, Gliese 581 was enveloped
        in concentric layers of satellites as the Entity grew and
        iterated its mind. Beta, on account of its great mass and its
        role as a store of fusion fuel, was left untouched. Gamma was
        partially dismantled by the time the Entity died.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Around Ctesiphon there was a constellation of millions of
        telescopes, forming an interferometer many light-days wide,
        large enough to resolve the reflection of a swallow on the
        waters of a river centuries away. But it had not been built to
        observe nature: instead it was aimed, perpetually, at the
        dwelling places of the gods. And it had recorded the Entity’s
        death in detail: a brief radio seizure, opal computers cooling
        down to equilibrium, the Entity’s headless transports flying on
        ballistic trajectories.</p>
        <p>Its mind had been a Dyson swarm: a cloud of some twenty
        million satellites, their orbital elements arranged such that
        they traced the surface of an imaginary torus. Absent
        station-keeping the careful arrangement fell apart. Some of the
        satellites swung around Beta and were catapulted into
        interstellar space, others entered collision cascades and dusted
        other satellites.</p>
        <p>The swarm around Gliese 581 now extends unevenly in every
        direction, there are immense arcs of satellites that ring voids
        larger than planets. It has the appearance of a frozen
        explosion, dull red embers floating in space. And the star is
        suffocated by them, entombed by them, its dim red light made
        dimmer, so that it looks like a blood-lamp seen through a mile
        of dense rain.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><em>Parandé</em> shed momentum and spiraled inwards, past the
        orbit of the gas giant, and they were in the depths of the
        swarm. The satellites were numerous enough and close enough that
        they could be seen with the naked eye. All were identical in
        appearance, but for collision damage. There were satellites
        whose photovoltaics were folded like the sails of a boat after a
        storm, and ones where the computing element was cratered and
        fractured.</p>
        <p>“Now all are fled,” <em>Parandé</em> said. “Even the
        gods.”</p>
        <p>They selected an intact-looking satellite and approached it
        cautiously. <em>Parandé</em> sent probes ahead.</p>
        <p>It was a hexagonal field of black photovoltaics, many
        kilometers wide. At the center was a sphere a kilometer in
        diameter, painted anti-flash white: a neuron. <em>Parandé</em>
        parked themselves over the photovoltaics on the lit side,
        halfway to the center, looking like they floated over a black
        ocean. They sent robots to search the hardware.</p>
        <p>There was armour, layers of smartmatter separated by vacuum.
        <em>Parandé</em>’s robots cut sixteen layers of the skull. And
        underneath: an opal ocean, convolved like a Hilbert curve. The
        delicate surface of the brain.</p>
        <p>They drilled core sections: columns hundreds of meters long,
        a hand’s width, like needles driven into a human brain. Little
        more than the first fifty meters was dense computing elements,
        the rest was long range axons. Intelligence, Asman explained, is
        bounded by power laws: each volume of computing requires an
        exponentially vaster volume of connections.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Attila and Timon worked on the surface, shepherding
        equipment.</p>
        <p>Timon extended a claw and scratched طیمون on the armour.</p>
        <p>Attila said:</p>
        <p>“If the gods are mortal, what hope is there for us?”</p>
        <p>The drill turned lazily in the blood-red light.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>At the highest level there was six-fold symmetry: six lobes,
        each identical, their surface packed with dense folds, like
        coral, cold and inert.</p>
        <p>Each lobe had identical gross anatomy, but below the
        mesoscale all symmetry, all seeming organization disappeared.
        The small-scale volumes were ruthlessly optimized, completely
        aperiodic and structureless. Or, if there was structure, it was
        at a level of organization too large to fit in the expert
        systems’ frames. This complicated their work.</p>
        <p>Timon drilled a disk-shaped sample—a small button—out of the
        cortex, and shone X-rays through it.</p>
        <p>Most computers were mechanical: nanometer-sized rods and
        linkages, frictionless and reversible, Analytical Engines in
        miniature. But there wasn’t enough carbon in the Gliese 581
        system to make the entire brain out of diamond ballistic logic.
        So the Entity had designed their hardware such that its
        elemental composition matched the local elemental abundance and
        scarcity: a matrix of silicon crystal, doped with metal atoms
        laid down with atomic precision, logic gates built by exploiting
        the properties of electrons, like in the first computers. But it
        was not a general purpose computer, running a mind in software,
        but neuromorphic hardware: an ASIC for nervous systems.</p>
        <p>They could have, in principle, dismantled it down to the
        atoms, and stored the position vector of each atom in a computer
        and beamed it over the network. Self-replicating factories and
        time had built the swarm; they, in turn, could reverse the
        process, dismantling the satellite and using its atoms to build
        more robots to dismantle the satellite.</p>
        <p>But the hardware was too optimized, and therefore too
        incompressible. The crystal structure of the brain was the most
        efficient encoding of itself. Storing or transmitting the atomic
        coordinates would require more storage and bandwidth than anyone
        had. So all work would have to be done <em>in situ</em>, with
        the analytical resources they had.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>In the underside of the satellite they found a module where
        maintenance robots sat idle: huge, utilitarian things shaped
        like radiolarians. Their hydraulic fluid had long ago leaked,
        their limbs floated in front of them, moving like branches in
        the wind as the satellite rotated slowly in space.</p>
        <p>“It looks like a barracks,” Attila said.</p>
        <p>There was industrial equipment: matter compilers and
        decompilers, and access to maintenance passages leading into the
        brain. They took photographs, and sent robots to map the empty
        tunnels. The machinery was ordinary: no new physics, nothing
        they could not decipher.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Timon printed an ASIC to run <em>ab initio</em> calculations.
        He scanned the logic gates in the hardware samples down to the
        atoms, and rebuilt them in the computer, and ran simulated
        voltages through them, collecting truth tables and
        characterizing their operation. With this data Sabra built
        larger simulations of isolated brain circuitry, turning
        crystallographic stereonets into circuit diagrams and then into
        systems of differential equations.</p>
        <p>The work yielded little: they could understand, mechanically,
        what happened at the lowest levels of organization, but they
        could make no assertions about higher-level behaviour.</p>
        <p>Sabra observed that they could say very little about
        cognition from structure alone and without brain activity.</p>
        <p>“We can try to start the brain and see how it behaves,” Timon
        said. “Just some functional unit.”</p>
        <p>“We wouldn’t know how,” Asman said. “The firmware is either
        random noise or encrypted. And it’s not protocol to try to
        revive them.”</p>
        <p>They had a plan: an expedition document, listing research
        protocols and the questions they sought to answer. How did the
        Entity die? Who were they, when they had been human? Had they
        ever been human? What was the architecture of their mind? Was it
        one mind, or many? And what they found was silence: computers
        made of cracked glass, machines with firmware memset to random
        noise.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>While the work went on, Sabra read in <em>Parandé</em>’s
        treasure about toposophy. She asked Asman for a list of key
        papers in the field, and traced the references backwards,
        building a DAG of citations back to antiquity, to the Heroic Age
        of Xerox PARC and the AI Lab.</p>
        <p>The toposophists studied the space of possible minds: its
        shape and the volumes that humans, posthumans, and the gods
        occupied within it; the universal theorems that governed agency
        and intelligence. But the more she read the less substance she
        found: unfalsifiable diagrams of brain architecture separated
        long paragraphs of abstract speculation, interrupted by
        premature mathematization and toy models of complex systems, and
        her eyes glazed over.</p>
        <p>Theoretical toposophists did little more than invent new
        taxonomies to classify the gods; by their mass, energy
        consumption, link topology, abstract measures of entropy or
        intelligence. But these categories were based on what little
        could be learned by remote observation.</p>
        <p>Without gods to vivisect, experimental toposophists built
        posthuman minds by recapitulating evolution in computers, and
        failed to understand their inner workings.</p>
        <p>Then there were case reports: where contact had not failed,
        and one of the gods had deigned to grow a language center and
        speak a human language. She discarded those where incredible or
        impossible phenomena were described, and was left with just the
        briefest reports. Where the gods were reluctant to speak, there
        was little to disbelieve.</p>
        <p>And on the rare occasion when a god dies, toposophists and
        grave-robbers descend on the body like insects, to steal and
        decipher what they can. Rarely is anything left: when the gods
        die, they die violently.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The toposophists who had remained in Ctesiphon—because they
        had families, research programs, because they were gregarious,
        or did not want to waste centuries on an uncertain venture—had
        distilled their knowledge, agendas, biases and feuds into expert
        systems. Asman woke them up, presented them their findings, and
        let them speak to each other. They traded insults in defeasible
        logic, but on the facts they were silent. The more they learned,
        the less they knew, and the more acrimonious their disagreements
        became. One of them said:</p>
        <p>“The ancients thought they could build gods—and chain them!
        But the gods are deaf to vanity: their ears are closed to
        it.”</p>
        <p>One by one she turned them off.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Weeks and months passed. They excavated a large volume of the
        brain, and from afar the robots looked like botflies feeding on
        the opal tissue. Finally Asman relented on protocol. The expert
        systems identified a strongly connected component of the nervous
        system: a cortical column where the neurons were deeply
        interconnected within and only weakly connected without. They
        separated it from the brain—a few cubic meters of glass—and
        identified the critical paths of the connectome, stuck probes in
        the axons and ran electricity through them.</p>
        <p>In a virtual EEG, Sabra watched patterns of activation appear
        and fade away almost immediately. And she thought of the
        complexity classes of cellular automata: in Life and other
        formalisms, intelligently-designed patterns could persist and
        even form universal computers, but most patterns one drew
        casually would either die instantly or collapse into simple
        oscillating structures. If there was a signal train that would
        restart the brain or part of it, it was beyond them to find
        it.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Sabra took a suit and went down to the surface. A few of
        <em>Parandé</em>’s robots—their bodies—worked soundlessly on the
        surface.</p>
        <p>The core drills stuck out of the armour, angled apart like
        the obelisks of Eratosthenes. Gliese 581 was low on the
        artificial horizon, casting infinite shadows.</p>
        <p>She stood at the edge of the dig, an inverted stepped pyramid
        cut into the opal, and climbed down the steps. The nadir was
        littered with left-over tools and dust. And an iridescent
        cylinder: a segment of a core sample that had broken off. She
        picked it up and turned it under the helmet lights.</p>
        <p>Obscure knowledge, knowledge of marvelous things, of the
        system of the world, had once passed through this—and left no
        imprint. When the gods die, they take their divine knowledge
        with them. Nothing remained but inert glass.</p>
        <p>Sabra thought: <em>but has not glass a kind of
        consciousness?</em> If esters in salt water or the gears of
        Babbage can think, why not atoms in Brownian motion in a
        crystal? What separates computation from the noise? What is
        noise but ciphertext without a key? What is computation without
        an interpretation? And she thought: <em>do the gods
        know?</em></p>
        <hr />
        <p>“There is nothing left for us to learn here,” Asman said.</p>
        <p>Attila suggested they explore the ruins of the Entity’s
        industry.</p>
        <p>They scanned the smaller and more representative samples down
        to the atoms and burned them. Then <em>Parandé</em> lit the
        engine and boosted higher. They left the satellite behind, with
        the inverted ziggurat of the dig site carved into its surface,
        like a patient who is forgotten after a failed surgery.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Gamma, the third planet, was partially dismantled, its
        surface had been <em>faceted</em>, made into an icosahedron with
        faces that had once been molten and had since petrified, like a
        black gem immobile in space. Its surface looked like silicon
        under an electron microscope: stepped terraces, vast flatlands
        interrupted by regular drops, kilometer-high sheer cliffs.
        Mantis-like robots sat idle, black with dust. There were
        factories buried under avalanches of slag. Nothing moved.</p>
        <p>Sabra wondered if this was how the planets of Beta Pictoris
        had looked like when they were being dismantled.</p>
        <p>An immense ring had been suspended around the planet, held up
        by immense towers, like the spokes of a wheel. Kilotons of
        molten rock flowed up the towers every second, the constant
        injection of momentum was the only thing holding up the
        structure. In the ring the rock was centrifuged, sorted into its
        constituent elements, and accelerated to the industrial zones
        elsewhere in the system. When the Entity died the flow of mass
        stopped, even diamond could not hold the weight, and the
        structure came down, fractured and broke up. The equator, ±
        fifteen degrees, was strewn with accidental arcologies,
        fragments of trusswork the size of cities, craters and fields of
        broken glass.</p>
        <p>And the orbits around Gamma were thick with dust and glass,
        ejecta sent into orbit by the force of the impact.</p>
        <p>The telescope around Ctesiphon had recorded the collapse:
        ghostly shards of ceramic smeared across the photoplates,
        falling faster than the instrument’s time resolution.</p>
        <p>The four members of the expedition shared a Cartesian
        theatre: a constructed view of the space around
        <em>Parandé</em>, where their avatars stood on an imaginary
        plane. Gamma was as tall as Sabra’s avatar. Imaginary lines of
        latitude and longitude were drawn over the planet, a sphere
        inscribing an icosahedron, which shifted orientation at times as
        the computer changed its mind about the planet’s shape.</p>
        <p>Asman’s avatar, which she hardly used, was a brass machine,
        gears and linkages pushed together so that they were shaped like
        a human, like an Arcimboldo portrait. <em>Parandé</em> had no
        avatar, and spoke as a disembodied voice:</p>
        <p>“Two items of interest.”</p>
        <p>And two orbits appeared around Gamma: purple was barely above
        the horizon and at a slight inclination, green was far above and
        sat perfectly still on the plane of the equator.</p>
        <p>“Firstly,” <em>Parandé</em> said.</p>
        <p>Then the view changed and Gamma became a sheer wall dividing
        half of the proscenium, turning slowly. Suspended over the
        planet’s zig-zag terminator was a ship with an unremarkable
        design: six white cylinders strapped to a central truss. A disk
        of ice sat at the front, studded with craters from centuries of
        micrometeorite impacts. At the back there was a bundle of thin,
        black rods: a single pipe, snaking back and forth many times.
        The back half of it had been blown apart, the pipes angled
        outwards like in a boiler explosion.</p>
        <p>They walked around it, inspecting it. <em>Parandé</em> had
        sent probes to photograph it from all sides at high
        resolution.</p>
        <p>The entire structure was shot through with holes and
        fractures, the hull was torn, the truss had cracked and was bent
        at a shallow angle.</p>
        <p>“That’s curious,” Timon remarked.</p>
        <p>They speculated as to what kind of catastrophe had taken
        place.</p>
        <p>“It doesn’t look like the Entity’s,” Asman said. “The
        Entity’s transports used catapults and beam-pushed sails
        exclusively.”</p>
        <p>“And the design is primitive,” Attila said.</p>
        <p>“Secondly,” <em>Parandé</em> said.</p>
        <p>They switched the view and Gamma was now far away,
        unreachable in the skybox.</p>
        <p>A black ring, distinguishable from the space around it only
        by its starless surface, floated still in the space between
        them. A slender torus: sixteen kilometers in diameter, 300
        meters in cross-section.</p>
        <p>“It’s made of carbon. One tenth of one gravity inside,” Timon
        said.</p>
        <p>The torus rotated slowly.</p>
        <p>“It’s as smooth and seamless as the lasers can tell,” he
        added. “But for this.”</p>
        <p>As the torus spun, a feature of the inward-facing surface
        turned to face them: a crater a hundred meters deep and twice as
        wide, its surface cracked and burned crystal.</p>
        <p>“This is the only blemish,” Timon said, “on an otherwise
        perfectly Platonic shape.”</p>
        <p>“We should begin with the wreck,” Asman said. “Since it is
        not likely to be the Entity’s.”</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They sent a swarm of robots to the wrecked ship, they flew in
        formation around it, translating and rotating with the precision
        of computer graphics. They found a nameplate:</p>
        <div class="nameplate">
        <p>J. B. S. Haldane</p>
        <p>Luhman 16 · Plus ultra</p>
        </div>
        <p>There were immense gashes in the hull through which blood-red
        light poured and pooled on white ceramic surfaces. The probes
        moved fore to aft, as they passed over the hull, the fractures
        lined up, and they could see Gamma’s serrated surface through
        the wreck.</p>
        <p>The inspected what was left of the engine. The first tenth of
        a de Laval nozzle clung on twisted metal rails to the frame of
        the wreck. <em>Parandé</em> said this was a nuclear salt-water
        engine, that it had gone critical and exploded. Dim embers of
        fissile material were scattered all over the hull, they had long
        decayed to almost nothing. The robots went inside.</p>
        <p>All debris had long either escaped into space or become
        electrostatically bound to the walls, and the interior was
        perfectly still. They found debris made of diamond and sapphire
        and ceramic, and even some that were crystals of iron doped with
        carbon, which Timon said the ancients had called
        <em>steel</em>.</p>
        <p>There were computers, too old and too ill to recover.</p>
        <p>And there were human bodies, encased in ceramic and packed
        six to a dewar like bullets in a revolver. The liquid nitrogen
        had long vented into space, the bodies had thawed and become
        desiccated. They drilled holes through the ceramic and the bones
        of the cephalon, took brain sections to confirm there was
        nothing left to save.</p>
        <p>Each sarcophagus was painted with scenes of paradise:
        animals, fruit trees and stone fountains where silver water
        flowed, naked men and women wreathed with flowers from the
        Garden of Eden.</p>
        <p>None of them had ever seen death. They, who could expect to
        live for hundreds of thousands of years, tried to emulate the
        stoicism of the ancients, for whom death was a daily concern.
        They worked dispassionately, taking samples and notes. They
        could not explain why they turned their faces from the
        photographs of the bodies in their ceramic enclosures, from the
        soundless, yellowed faces.</p>
        <p>“I don’t think this was an expedition to the Entity”, Asman
        decided.</p>
        <p>“No,” <em>Parandé</em> agreed. “It is much too old. And the
        way the bodies are packed—”</p>
        <p>It was a settlement ship, they agreed, they had gone to
        Gliese 581 to settle the third planet, which <em>Parandé</em>
        said had once been potentially habitable. And when they arrived
        the system was already occupied by the Entity. They wondered
        whether the Entity had fired at the ship, or if, in desperation,
        the crew had themselves pulled the control rods.</p>
        <p>Not knowing what to do, they left the bodies intact, in
        place, and hoped that a later visitor might know how to inhume
        or incinerate them decently.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They sent a small probe to drill a sample from the crater on
        the torus. The probe scanned the sample <em>in situ</em>, then,
        rather than risk contamination, it deorbited itself and fell
        down to Gamma’s surface.</p>
        <p>Again they gathered in a Cartesian theatre, this time a blue
        void where a three-dimensional model appeared: an Ångström-level
        cutaway view of the core sample, reconstructed from combined NMR
        and crystallography. In place of a ball-and-stick model, the
        atoms were infinitesimal points of coloured light, the bonds
        were translucent masses shaped after the Laplacian of the
        electron density, calculated <em>ab initio</em> from the atom
        coordinates. A unit cube, a micron wide, bounded the
        universe.</p>
        <p>Layers of pressed diamond were separated by micron-thick
        rifts, and tendrils of explosively-formed graphene bridged the
        gaps like flaps of torn skin.</p>
        <p>“Mechanical compression,” Timon said, walking through the
        immaterial electrons, and gesturing with his head along the
        curve of a fracture.</p>
        <p>“Gamma ray embrittlement, here and here.”</p>
        <p>He pointed to two completely indistinct volumes of the
        crystal.</p>
        <p>“There’s evidence of neutron activation,” Timon continued,
        “but exclusively along the lines of gamma ray embrittlement. The
        radiation was intense enough to photodisintegrate the
        carbon.”</p>
        <p>“Conversion,” <em>Parandé</em> said.</p>
        <p>“That’s right,” Timon said.</p>
        <p>“Conversion munitions?,” Asman asked.</p>
        <p>“Working backwards from the shape of the crater and the
        inverse square law: about ten grams of antiprotons,” Timon
        said.</p>
        <p>Asman objected: “That doesn’t make sense. There should be
        nothing left.”</p>
        <p>“Maybe it fizzled out,” Sabra said.</p>
        <p>“It must have been propulsion,” <em>Parandé</em> said. “An
        engine detonation. When the Entity died there were hundreds of
        thousands of vehicles moving across the system. One of its
        rockets must have impacted the torus and exploded.”</p>
        <p>“The Entity used sails and catapults exclusively,” Asman
        said. “The telescope in Ctesiphon kept track of this. We know
        exactly how many ships the Entity had.”</p>
        <p>“The <em>J. B. S. Haldane</em> was fission,” Sabra said. “We
        didn’t find anything more advanced.”</p>
        <p>“Another expedition must have come by here,” Asman said, “and
        caused this.”</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They illuminated the torus with RADAR and tried the contact
        protocols and when nothing answered, they decided to go
        inside.</p>

        <section id="without-organs" class="level1">
        <h1>Without Organs</h1>
        <div class="chapter-start">
        <p><em>drowned — starlings — this is all that you are</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>Gliese 581 was drowned in satellites, still, they were awash
        in blood-red light, the white trusswork of the transport turned
        pink. Sabra turned back on her seat, and saw <em>Parandé</em>’s
        broadside, half a kilometer long but already barely visible.
        Timon sat behind her, and he was darker than the space around
        them, the dim longwave light sank into his skin, while the void
        was aglow with zodiacal light. He looked back at her, and the
        <em>tapeta lucida</em> behind his eyes blinked red for an
        instant.</p>
        <p>The torus was made of diamond. Where the crater had formed,
        the surface had not crumpled or collapsed: it pyrolized and
        turned to smoke. The solid surface was buried under a layer of
        soot.</p>
        <p>They stopped the transport next to the torus, and waited for
        the crater to appear. Its only salient feature was a narrow
        opening, like a syringe needle seen under a microscope: a square
        tunnel transected by a plane at a shallow angle, large enough
        for human-shaped explorers.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> took over the controls and matched the
        tangential velocity of the torus, pulling gently up and seeming
        to float over the crater. The transport arced down to the
        epicenter, where the cracks on the diamond converged at a
        singular point, and they landed softly on jets of cold gas.</p>
        <p>Flecks of <em>sp²</em>-bonded carbon swarmed them like black
        insects as the exhaust blew soot off the surface.</p>
        <p>They stabbed poles into the crater surface, and fastened the
        transport to them, and walked awkwardly, in the low gravity,
        along a surface like a beach of burnt sand. Short columns,
        burned like matchsticks, protruded from the surface, and a long
        crystal spar lay across the ground, terminating in a flaked
        wheel-shaped thing. Timon suggested it was the cable reel of a
        gantry.</p>
        <p>Sabra and Attila wore Class IV suits. Timon, who was the
        beast of burden, wore a harness carrying bags of equipment on
        his naked body.</p>
        <p>The entryway was diamond, the walls burned into slippery
        graphite. They walked slowly and their feet cracked the
        vitrified debris beneath them. Soon they were entombed in
        darkness, and they found, at the end of the passage a heavy
        intact wall. Near the center: an alcove with a huge, heavy
        lever.</p>
        <p>They scraped soot from the walls to make a smooth seal, took
        out a portable airlock, unfolded it, and turned it on. The
        actuators pressed the frame of the airlock against the walls and
        they pressurized the interior with neon gas from a tank, until a
        device inside the wall made a clicking sound. They pumped the
        lever a few times, slowly, the wall moved aside.</p>
        <p>The passage had a square profile. The floor was coarse,
        monocrystalline diamond, textured with waves like poured glass,
        backed by a jet-black surface, so that it looked like a mirror.
        The walls and ceiling were verdigris, like worn copper, carved
        intricately with stylized pistons, trip hammers, pump jacks and
        images of other mechanical devices. Everywhere, lichen and
        mold-like growths spotted the walls.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere was nitrogen and oxygen and ash.</p>
        <p>The walls seemed to swallow the light from their lamps, but
        the floor, with its uneven surface, shone back at them when
        illuminated.</p>
        <p>Sabra inspected one of the walls. She put a gloved finger
        over a lichen-thing: a broad, shallow button, like a model of
        Olympus Mons, gray and textured like book gills. At the
        slightest pressure it collapsed. She withdrew her finger: a spot
        of gray ash, completely uniform.</p>
        <p>The passage went on and curved upwards and away in the
        distance.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They walked kilometers down the passage, and at regular
        intervals they found doors on the left wall: square doors made
        of diamond, textured and structurally-coloured to look like red
        wood. The rooms behind them were almost cubes, most were empty.
        There was a room filled with radio equipment, all conforming to
        centuries-old standards. Coarse, EM-shielded cables disappeared
        into a socket in the wall.</p>
        <p>Sometimes Timon would stop, and feel the ground with SONAR.
        But for the passage and the rooms there was little empty space:
        the rest of the torus was bulk matter—which they guessed were
        computers or storage—and pipes and banks of cylindrical things
        they assumed were flywheels.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Asman was born in Tigranes—HD 35650 in the catalogues. Early
        in life, her clan had funded, at great expense, her Grand Tour
        of the network. Arriving in Ctesiphon there was a great upheaval
        in the markets—owing to the birth of new god, some tens of years
        away—and her funds became worthless overnight. And this provided
        an excellent excuse never to return: had she toured every
        settled star, she would have seen less variety than in
        Ctesiphon.</p>
        <p>And she remembered how a society was turned upside down by
        the mere report of a theogony. These confident people had
        mastered themselves and the world around them, and were like
        titans, who felt neither fear nor hunger, but at the sight of a
        deity they saw terror and the sublime in one, they resumed an
        atavistic nature, and prayed cynically to gods they had long
        discarded.</p>
        <p>She trained as a toposophist to learn the nature of the
        gods.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>After hours of exploration, they pitched a tent in the middle
        of the passage. They went inside, and began talking about the
        kinds of things that the sight of ruins and the dead evoke.</p>
        <p>“Imagine,” Sabra began, “explaining our lives to someone from
        the anthropocene. Disembodied souls, traveling on beams of
        light. Poured again into bodies made of glass; bodies without
        organs. Minds made of spinning gears. The dreams of Babbage come
        true.”</p>
        <p>“To them, we are like demigods,” Timon said, and left unsaid:
        <em>but not gods</em>.</p>
        <p>The lamp light dimmed and they slept on the ancient
        twenty-four hour day.</p>
        <p>Sabra dreamt of an angel shaped like the Antikythera
        mechanism, gears clicking like hangings, suspended over an
        infinite grid of human beings. The hearts of the dead are
        weighed at the end of time.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>There was a room full of feigned starlings. They flew,
        groomed their feathers, sang and brooded in empty nests. But
        they were transected down the midline, the left half missing.
        And the cutaway showed brass pipes for the syrinx, a flywheel,
        and a gearbox that drove the entire mechanism. Attila stole a
        bird from a nest; methodically, he dismantled it.</p>
        <p>“Sixty one gears,” he reported. As if the artist had said:
        <em>this is all that you are</em>.</p>
        <p>“There must be hidden logic,” Timon said. “A computer
        embedded in the gears. How does it know where to go? How to fly
        straight?”</p>
        <p>“The flywheel makes up for the missing wing, I think,” Attila
        explained. “It turns counterclockwise and the bird rolls
        right.”</p>
        <p>And Timon thought: <em>they are saying, ‘I am mighty, I can
        do great things with almost nothing’</em>.</p>
        <p>“How are they still moving?,” Timon asked.</p>
        <p>Sabra inspected one of the nests.</p>
        <p>“There is a rotor at the base, here,” she observed. A
        four-sided knob, turning slowly. “It must charge the
        flywheel.”</p>
        <p>“It must be a memory,” Attila said.</p>
        <p>Branches made of tinted glass extended from the walls,
        looking like mountains in Persian miniature.</p>
        <p>Carefully, Attila reassembled the bird and put it in a sample
        container. One eye, a glass marble, stared at nothing when he
        closed the lid.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>“The astronomers looked through their telescopes and saw the
        moon of a gas giant had turned an opal texture.”</p>
        <p>They walked in silence, and Asman spoke over the radio,
        describing a prior expedition.</p>
        <p>“It was close to Ctesiphon, on a settled system. So we went
        on the network. Just a few years. Very brief. Not like
        this.”</p>
        <p>Thousands of toposophists had come along, she said.</p>
        <p>“It was a glass sphere of logic. It shed heat by shooting
        arcs of liquid sodium into space, like magnetic field lines made
        real. We never saw anything like it again.</p>
        <p>“Parts of it were hot, but most of the volume was frozen. And
        we guessed that it was half-dead, or sick, or pupating and
        preparing for a metamorphosis.</p>
        <p>“We went down a cooling pipe that had broken and vented into
        space. We found maintenance tunnels for robots, hexagonal
        passages with corrugated surfaces. The robots were half-dead,
        occasionally one would see us, track us with its eyes, and turn
        off again.</p>
        <p>“We didn’t dare drill samples, because it was not dead. Not
        entirely. But we learned what we could from X-ray scattering and
        induction, and from the surfaces that were exposed.</p>
        <p>Then we reached a warm area. We heard the hum of electricity.
        And we tried the standard contact protocols: the Taylor series,
        the cubes of Hinton.”</p>
        <p>Then, she said, it had come alive.</p>
        <p>“We were swept by waves of blinding light. And I heard the
        smell of iodine. Then all the light left us.”</p>
        <p>For a moment, there was no sound but their steps.</p>
        <p>“And we were compelled to confess things,” she said. “Our
        most secret things are the most parochial. If we knew the
        contents of each other’s minds we would not suffer.”</p>
        <p>Timon said he heard an unsteady drumming sound, kilometers
        away.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><em>Parandé</em>’s probes arced over the planet surface,
        their gravimeters measured changes in the local gravity that
        could not be explained by Gamma’s faceted shape. So they sent a
        seed factory to a carbon-rich area of Gamma’s surface. It grew a
        small phalanx of robots, other bodies of <em>Parandé</em>, which
        they could operate simultaneously through an engineered form of
        hemispatial neglect.</p>
        <p>In places the surface was rows and rows of corrugated
        trenches, like plowed soil, elsewhere, it was an ocean of liquid
        metal that had solidified. The robots split into packs and
        traversed the land, they drew power from the dim light of Gliese
        581, fixed in the sky above them. Gamma was tidally locked, and
        they could only work in the sunlit half.</p>
        <p>A mountain range of aluminium oxide—of sapphire—rose above
        them: the remains of the orbital ring that had come down from
        heaven when the Entity died. They unfolded photovoltaics in the
        foothills, scaled the cracked glass walls and climbed inside. In
        the dark red light, the shadows and the light were hardly
        distinguishable.</p>
        <p>The interior was a collapsed tensegrity, a jumble of diamond
        bones, connected by slack ropes, like the rotting fascia of a
        beast that once bestrode the world.</p>
        <p>They walked through caverns made of glass and crushed rock.
        Where the structure had impacted the ground, the diamond had
        explosively formed fullerenes, and their limbs became covered
        with soot, like the bodies of men who, in the days of Turing and
        the ancients, had worked in coal mines.</p>
        <p>They found the coils of the catapults that launched and
        caught payloads to and from the Dyson swarm, crushed together
        like Rouleaux complexes in the blood of a dead animal. They
        found plasma gasifiers and electric furnaces and a smelting
        plant hundreds of kilometers long.</p>
        <p>They found a power distribution center: miles and miles of
        high-tension lines and transformer stations. And where the power
        lines converged there was an immense structure, a capped
        cylinder made of a foam-like white ceramic, like a pill, stabbed
        with pipes in every direction. Concentric layers of armour were
        separated by hydraulic pistons, it had survived the collapse of
        the orbital ring intact. They cut their way through it and their
        Geiger counters began clicking in brief, ominous spikes.</p>
        <p>Inside was something like a fusion reactor. There was a
        magnetic pipe, through which charged plasma could travel, and an
        MHD generator to convert the energy in the plasma into
        electricity. And, between them, a vacuum chamber braced by huge
        pillars, as if holding an immense weight.</p>
        <p>They opened the chamber, and Cherenkov sparks danced in the
        opening, they lit the dark of the ruins with stroboscopic blue
        light.</p>
        <p>Where there should have been a fusor there was instead a flat
        disk two meters wide, a centimeter thick, gleaming white
        ceramic, cracked and spalled. In the center was a narrow
        opening. Light was bent and refracted through the opening, so
        that it looked like a lens.</p>
        <p>The expedition in the torus had set up camp in an empty room
        adjacent to the passage. Timon woke up when <em>Parandé</em>
        pinged him, and a high-resolution scan of the device rotated in
        his Cartesian theatre. He asked:</p>
        <p>“What is remarkable about this?”</p>
        <p>And <em>Parandé</em> said:</p>
        <p>“It masses sixty thousand tons.”</p>
        <p>They didn’t want to bring it up to orbit until they knew what
        it was, and they didn’t want to recall Timon from the torus. So
        he operated one of <em>Parandé</em>’s bodies remotely, he laid
        down in the tent and closed his eyes, and his limbs twitched as
        in a dream.</p>
        <p>They began by clearing the ruins. <em>Parandé</em>’s robots
        carried matter compilers and feedstock, and they printed the
        pieces of an immense gantry, they lifted the disk so that it was
        held up by strained cables in a posture of strange reverence and
        placed it inside a vacuum chamber studded with hermetic
        sensors.</p>
        <p>They swept a diffractometer around it, and saw that the rim
        of the disk was made of ceramic and tungsten and, around the
        lens-like thing, a superconductor.</p>
        <p>They shone light across as many frequencies as they could
        through the lens and saw that it was transparent to everything
        from radio to x-rays.</p>
        <p>They tried to touch the surface of the lens with an atomic
        force microscope, and the nanogram probe exploded like a hand
        grenade. The sensors saw exotic particles and gamma rays, and
        <em>Parandé</em> predicted:</p>
        <p>“It’s made of magnetic monopoles.”</p>
        <p>Timon’s treasure explained that these were hypothetical
        particles, one of the many items in the catalogue of things
        theorized and never found; each one would be smaller than a
        proton, mass one Planck mass, and would act as a magnet with a
        single pole. And, importantly, when they came into contact with
        baryonic matter, they catalyzed baryon decay.</p>
        <p>So they set up a different experiment: they shot megadalton
        pellets of metal through the opening, they passed through—and
        disappeared with a shower of exotic particles. And the expert
        systems confirmed they were observing baryon decay.</p>
        <p>They repeated the experiment thousands of times, at the
        request of the expert systems, and when they had a statistical
        sample of the decay modes and their branching ratios, they
        slotted the results into the unknowns of the theories.</p>
        <p>For a sublime moment, <em>Parandé</em> and Timon were the
        only minds, other than the gods, who knew the whole system of
        the world.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The gods could convert matter into energy, that this was
        widely known and attested by telescopic evidence of gamma-ray
        emissions. And the entire pantheon had to use the same
        mechanism, because the gamma ray flares always had the same
        energies. But that nobody knew how, and experimental physics had
        drawn its last breath centuries prior.</p>
        <p>When Ctesiphon was settled they had built a circumstellar
        accelerator, twice the radius of Beta Pictoris and supported
        dynamically by its own operation. They ran it for a century, and
        drew the last of high energy physics, and tore it apart to build
        spin habitats. But they had failed to find grand unification or
        any of the long-sought after theories of everything. And here
        the Entity had done, over the course of a few decades, what
        10<sup>15</sup> posthumans had failed to do with a collider
        larger than a star.</p>
        <p>They gathered in a Cartesian theatre, where Timon and
        <em>Parandé</em> explained their findings.</p>
        <p>“It’s a device,” <em>Parandé</em> began, “for converting
        matter into energy. Baryonic matter passes through and the
        entire mass of it decays into charged pions and mesons, then to
        gamma rays. One hundred per cent efficient.”</p>
        <p>“The thing in the middle, that looks like a lens, is a
        crystal monolayer,” said Timon, “made of magnetic monopoles.
        They catalyze baryon decay by the Callan-Rubakov mechanism. Like
        reusable antimatter, if you want.”</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> had termed it a conversion device.</p>
        <p>Sabra asked the first question:</p>
        <p>“It can’t be dense enough to show gravitational lensing. Why
        does it look”—she gestured at the high-resolution scan of the
        device, floating in their Cartesian theatre—“like a lens?”</p>
        <p>Timon explained:</p>
        <p>“Monopoles screen the magnetic field like electrons screen
        the electric field. It refracts light because it’s an insulator,
        implying the charges—the monopoles—are immobile in space.”</p>
        <p>“You said ‘crystal’”, said Attila. “How do you know it’s a
        crystal? How would monopoles be bonded together? And to the
        device?”</p>
        <p>“We don’t know,” Parandé said. “And neither do the expert
        systems. We posed these questions to them. We <em>suppose</em>
        they are in a crystalline arrangement because they are fixed in
        space, but we can’t see monopoles directly. They might be in
        some kind of bound state analogous to chemical bonds. As to the
        second question: the lens is levitated all around by a
        superconductor.”</p>
        <p>“There is a mass defect,” Timon added. “We can calculate the
        monopole-baryon interaction cross-section from theory. The
        expert systems can, at any rate. This tells us how far apart the
        monopoles have to be spaced to get total conversion. And we know
        the surface area of the lens. Taken together, we know the number
        of monopoles there should be in the crystal. But if you multiply
        this by the Planck mass you get one third of the total inertial
        mass of the entire device.</p>
        <p>“So either there are extra monopoles—perhaps these act as a
        binder?—or there is some unknown force, or some arrangement of
        unknown particles we cannot see because they don’t
        interact.”</p>
        <p>Sabra asked how the device could have been built.</p>
        <p>“I have no idea,” Timon said. “This is far beyond me. This is
        <em>femtotechnology</em>.”</p>
        <p>“Then a more productive question is <em>where</em>,” she
        said. “Because this seems out of place, no? So far all the
        equipment we have found is made of baryonic matter and we can
        understand, at least on a mechanistic level, how it all
        works.”</p>
        <p>“The telescope in Ctesiphon,” Asman said. “Tracked a
        high-energy industrial zone of the Entity’s. A space station, at
        a low altitude over Gliese 581. Huge photovoltaics, huge gamma
        ray flares every hour. When the Entity died the stationkeeping
        presumably failed: after two months it went down into the
        photosphere and broke up. That may be the <em>where</em>.”</p>
        <p>“The paucity of exotic devices,” Attila said. “Might be
        explained by cost. If it takes terajoules to make one monopole
        it would take a long time for a conversion reactor to repay that
        energy expenditure.”</p>
        <p>“There’s other devices,” Timon said. “Scattered across the
        surface. Other reactors. The Entity needed a lot of energy to
        dismantle Gamma, far more than could be provided by the light of
        Gliese 581.”</p>
        <p>“We got lucky,” said <em>Parandé</em>. “The mass of the
        device and the intensity of the radiation means they were very
        thoroughly braced and shielded, so the other reactors survived
        largely intact. We can bring them back to Wepwawet for
        study.”</p>
        <p>Asman ended the discussion: she said that this was invaluable
        but it told them nothing about the Entity’s mind. But
        <em>Parandé</em> was undeterred. They spoke excitedly: physics
        has been solved, grand unification, that last dream of the
        ancients, has been deciphered. The transformation of matter into
        light had yesterday been a miracle, known only to the gods:
        today it was science.</p>
        <p>Sabra noticed that <em>Parandé</em> had six distinct voices,
        which she thought corresponded to the minds of the original
        crew, that they spoke sometimes simultaneously but mostly
        isolated in their distinct sentences. One voice spoke
        exclusively of propulsion and orbital mechanics, another spoke
        timidly, another spoke boldly.</p>
        <p>Sabra and Attila packed away the tent into the bags and
        mounted them on Timon’s harness. Then they resumed their travel
        down the passage.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The smell had become impossible to ignore when Timon
        said:</p>
        <p>“I hear a human heartbeat.”</p>
        <p>Everything was still.</p>
        <p>They walked for kilometers until they found a collapsed tent,
        once-white fabric draped over the outlines of boxes and human
        bodies. Empty cans were strewn around the floor.</p>
        <p>Attila unzipped the entrance, dragged out three mylar
        sleeping bags, and laid them out side by side on the mirror-like
        surface. Indistinguishable human remains, mummified, wearing
        identical, simple clothing. They didn’t know where to begin
        investigating the cause of death: they had no biologists on the
        crew, let alone human anatomists.</p>
        <p>Next to the tent there was a door, and they stood there in
        silence for some time. Timon said someone was inside.</p>
        <p>They opened the door, and a wall of humidity struck them, and
        a renewed smell of decomposition.</p>
        <p>There were crates of equipment, broken batteries, dead lamps,
        life support equipment with time-worn, stained surfaces, and a
        thin mylar sleeping bag. Inside, a man made of flesh.</p>
        <p>The mylar surface heaved up and down, reflecting faint light
        at them.</p>
        <p>They remained silent, and unmoving. It seemed the most
        natural thing in the world to observe this atavistic man in
        somber silence: a memory from the anthropocene, like a museum
        exhibit, from the time when the dead outnumbered the living.</p>
        <p>“He’s old,” Attila said.</p>
        <p>“I can’t see through the metal,” Timon said.</p>
        <p>Carefully, Sabra removed the mylar sheet off the man’s
        body.</p>
        <p>Through millimeter-wave eyes Timon saw a cavern of dying
        flesh, a human heart with thick walls and a thick septum, tired
        muscle, blood reverberating, barely moving.</p>
        <p>“He’s near death,” he said.</p>
        <p>“We have to bring him to <em>Parandé</em>,” Sabra said.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> cut in immediately:</p>
        <p>“Absolutely not,” they said. “Samples, not living things. We
        don’t know what <em>it</em> is. It could be a device of the
        Entity’s.”</p>
        <p>Timon asked if they had the plans for a sarcophagus in the
        treasure.</p>
        <p>Reluctantly, <em>Parandé</em> sent a robot with a matter
        compiler on the backup transport, printing the sarcophagus as it
        fell down the Hill sphere to the torus. It landed on the crater,
        and raced down the passage carrying the finished product.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the members of the expedition argued
        anxiously.</p>
        <p>Timon said that he must have been one of the people from the
        wrecked ship. Sabra opined that <em>Parandé</em> was right, that
        he was a creation of the Entity, that perhaps the Entity was
        alive and this was a trap of some kind.</p>
        <p>And Attila speculated that this was the Entity’s genitor, the
        man the Entity had been before their theogony. That when the
        Entity had died he had become trapped here. That if humans
        collect photographs and objects of childhood, then it stands to
        reason by proportionality that the gods should collect persons
        or entire worlds.</p>
        <p>The robot surged out of the darkness, almost as large as the
        passage, a crab-like machine painted international orange, with
        a cluster of bulbous eyes. It moved with a swiftness that belied
        its size. When it reached them, it carefully deposited the
        sarcophagus from its many-armed embrace.</p>
        <p>Timon radioed <em>Parandé</em>:</p>
        <p>“The bodies.”</p>
        <p>The robot stood unmoving, tracking Timon with its many
        eyes.</p>
        <p>“Please.”</p>
        <p>“It won’t clear the smell,” <em>Parandé</em> said inside his
        head.</p>
        <p>The robot lowered its body, it picked up each of the bodies
        in their mylar bags and placed them in a cargo basket. Then,
        without a word, it turned back and walked up the passage.</p>
        <p>A slate coffin sat on the mirror-like floor. They opened it
        and ran the diagnostics, it asserted that it was functioning.
        Then it began to fill with fluid.</p>
        <p>The man was still asleep. Sabra tried to rouse him, and
        asked, in the language of Ctesiphon:</p>
        <p>“Can you understand me?”</p>
        <p>He opened clouded eyes, coughed and lost consciousness.</p>
        <p>Attila and Sabra undressed him and heaved his body into the
        sarcophagus.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>His body swelled, the tissues filled with fluid and became
        edematous, opening the gaps between the cells, for the
        sarcophagus’ repair machines—a genus and ecology of engineered
        bacteria and viruses—to travel and do their work. Machine arms
        cut his skull open so that his brain could swell. Old waste was
        swept away, and his body grew young inside out.</p>
        <p>Colour returned to his hair, and even the lens of the eye,
        which is unchanged from cradle to grave, was dissolved and grown
        anew.</p>
        <p>He spent days in the sarcophagus while it ministered to him,
        and the three members of the expedition waited and argued about
        his identity.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> was anxious, and thought he was a danger, a
        trick of the Entity’s. They brought up the possibility of
        leaving.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>He woke up, coughed once, and opened his eyes. Golden light
        from the discharge lamps filled the room. He was naked under a
        sheet of pale blue fabric, and lay on an inflatable mattress,
        next to and parallel to the sarcophagus.</p>
        <p>Sabra stepped into the light, and introduced herself
        perfunctorily, pointing at herself when she said her name. He
        saw her and closed his eyes, and said something in an old
        language.</p>
        <p>She dredged the grammar from her memories, and introduced
        herself again.</p>
        <p>“My name is Sabra,” she said. “I’m a linguist. We came on the
        interstellar vehicle <em>Parandé</em>.” Then added: “What is
        your name?”</p>
        <p>He wore an uncomfortable expression.</p>
        <p>“From where?,” he asked.</p>
        <p>“From Ctesiphon,” she replied. “Beta Pictoris.”</p>
        <p>He considered this.</p>
        <p>“There, men are like gods,” he said.</p>
        <p>Timon stood outside the room, listening to an expert system
        translate, and thought: <em>sad, farcical, epigonic
        gods</em>.</p>
        <p>“My name is Tiet,” he said quietly.</p>
        <p>He sat up, and looked directly at one of the lamps for some
        time, and closed his eyes.</p>
        <p>“Am I alive?,” he asked. “Am I still made of flesh?”</p>
        <p>He opened his eyes and looked at her.</p>
        <p>“Yes,” she answer hurriedly. “We didn’t change anything. The
        sarcophagus—,” she pointed at it, “—turned back time.”</p>
        <p>After he said nothing, she asked:</p>
        <p>“Did you come here on the <em>J. B. S. Haldane</em>? From
        Luhman 16?”</p>
        <p>“I have no idea what you are talking about.”</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> whispered to Sabra over the radio: “Don’t
        say anything unnecessary.”</p>
        <p>“I was a historian on the <em>Futurological Congress</em>,”
        he added. “We came from Ararat.”</p>
        <p>“How long have you been here?”</p>
        <p>He was looking down at his arms, running a finger tenderly
        over the skin of his left forearm, and said under his
        breath:</p>
        <p>“Indeed like gods.”</p>
        <p>Half-formed tears sat on his eyelids. He turned to her and
        said in a low voice:</p>
        <p>“A long time.”</p>
        <p>“There is a wreck in another orbit, around the planet. The
        nameplate says <em>J. B. S. Haldane</em>. There are human bodies
        there.”</p>
        <p>“There are a lot of things in orbit,” he said. “We were in
        too serious an emergency to make a thorough search.”</p>
        <p>“What happened?”</p>
        <p>He shrugged.</p>
        <p>“An accident,” he said. “How else do people die nowadays?
        Stupidly.”</p>
        <p>At this, his expression changed, and he continued
        impassively:</p>
        <p>“Four of us went in here. The others landed the
        <em>Congress</em> on the planet below.”</p>
        <p>“<em>Land?</em>,” Timon whispered to Sabra over the radio.
        “An interstellar vehicle?”</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, <em>Parandé</em> began scouring their photographs
        of the planet surface.</p>
        <p>“We never heard from them again.”</p>
        <p>“Did you blow the crater?,” she asked. “The crater on the
        torus surface?”</p>
        <p>He looked up at her.</p>
        <p>“We came in through the crater. That was already there.”</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> spoke in her head:</p>
        <p>“Found it. It broke up, near the remains of the orbital ring.
        Human bodies under a lean-to. I can see them on SAR.”</p>
        <p>“There were, in the passage outside—”</p>
        <p>“They died,” he said, matter-of-factly, “over the years, when
        the life support was too aged.”</p>
        <p>She said nothing.</p>
        <p>“We heard a voice in the walls, in the first year,” Tiet
        said. “It tried to speak twice.”</p>

        <p>When Tiet was better oriented, Attila came into the room and
        introduced himself, followed by Timon. Asman spoke over the
        radio.</p>
        <p>Sabra stayed with Tiet in the sarcophagus room. After all the
        lost years, the stench of decomposition, the darkness, growing
        old again and knowing he was beyond saving—he was desperate to
        leave, to be allowed on <em>Parandé</em>. And <em>Parandé</em>
        kept insisting that he was a trick, a device of the Entity, that
        if he came aboard they would die. So Sabra had to dissemble and
        buy time, and give Tiet vague assurances that soon they would
        leave.</p>
        <p>To pass the time, she showed him the cubes of Hinton, through
        which the four dimensions of space could be intuited. Timon and
        Attila continued down the passage.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>A division-sized force worked on Gamma’s surface, they had
        built a radial city, kilometers wide. Concentric rings housed,
        from the outside in: mining, smelting, sorting, matter
        compilation, parts assembly, and in the center: a launch
        complex.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> had stolen from the gods, and built
        themselves a new engine.</p>
        <p>Gas was pumped through a helical antenna, where it became
        plasma, thence through a magnetic pipe and through the
        conversion device. And out the other side: decay
        products—charged π-mesons and neutral muons, and rarely
        kaons—traveling at one-third of the speed of light. They passed
        through and exchanged momentum with a magnetic nozzle, pushing
        the spacecraft forward, later they decayed into gamma rays, for
        which there were thousands of tons of tungsten shielding, shot
        through with sodium heat exchangers.</p>
        <p>It was a continuous gamma ray bomb, with thrust provided only
        by the brief lifetime of the exotic products of proton
        decay.</p>
        <p>They tested the engine, firing it vertically into space: a
        narrow column of fire and light shot up in a straight line for a
        few light-seconds before it cooled enough to become invisible.
        And when they were satisfied they brought it into orbit.</p>
        <p>The mass of the conversion device would have made it
        impossible to lift into orbit, but the engine’s thrust-to-weight
        ratio was greater than one. So <em>Parandé</em> built six
        spherical fuel tanks above the engine, mounted on a hexagonal
        frame, and lifted the entire structure atop a launch tower, far
        enough from the ground that the exhaust would not be reflected
        back.</p>
        <p>They lit the engine and the launch tower, and the kilometers
        of factories around it, and their thousands of bodies sublimated
        in an instant. The engine, with its temporary stores of fuel,
        climbed slowly, underneath, the metal surface of Gamma glowed
        and liquefied.</p>
        <p>They steered it through the orbits with brief burns and
        attached it to themselves.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They walked 109° of the torus’ circumference when they
        reached the end of the passage: a door with dark guiltwork, an
        intricate lock mechanism. Attila began examining the mechanism
        when Timon said,</p>
        <p>“Enough of this.”</p>
        <p>Exhausted, he used his head as a battering ram and forced the
        door open. The room was irregular, with walls of porous stone
        like chondrite. Its contents included: a Byzantine icon of
        George Berkeley; a water integrator; a gas computer; a
        mechanical 64-bit adder—a Babbage device, like Timon’s brain,
        scaled up a billionfold; a Persian rug made of Wang tiles, whose
        weave was the multiplication of two prime numbers; a computer
        made of the eddy currents in the plasma of a gas discharge lamp;
        a computer made of interference patterns in beams of light
        inside a small crystal of corundum. All were unpowered, and the
        room’s scant air was argon. There was an explosive sound as the
        atmosphere from the passage rushed into the room.</p>
        <p>Where the walls converged there was a door made of
        protein—made of wood. Carved on its surface were scenes from the
        creation: the parting of the waters from the earth,
        nucleosynthesis, the first wind, the first men, the second men,
        the third men learning the language of the birds, Turing as a
        divine geometer, the birth of the gods. They opened it and found
        a door made of Roman concrete. They opened it and found a door
        made of pretensioned glass; then a door made of ceramic; a door
        made of calcium carbonate, carved with the shapes of crinoids
        and ripple marks like a fossil bed from the Carboniferous; a
        door made of forged bronze coins from the reign of Scipio
        Africanus, pressed together into two symmetrical slabs; a door
        made of silicon carbide; a door made of anthracite coal, and on
        its surface, painted with gold dust, were scenes from Fedorovist
        eschatology: galaxies turned dim and ochre with Matrioshka
        brains; the computer at the end of time; the resurrection of the
        dead; Fedorov, Tipler, and de Chardin in a garden of lithium
        flowers, holding forth on the philosophy of the Common Task; a
        golden jackal devouring a human heart; stars surrounded by
        wheels within wheels that were Dyson rings; time becomes a
        strange loop, and the gods build themselves in the past.</p>
        <p>Behind the last door was a huge rectangular room, extensively
        ornamented in an ancient style, walls and a ceiling clad in
        amber, fake windows of frosted glass hiding diodes. In the
        center of the room, six metal cabinets on a Persian rug: a
        replica VAX-11. Magnetic tape spun lazily. There was a chair in
        front of a teletype terminal, a paper printout spilled out of
        the teletype and formed a pile on the floor.</p>
        <p>This was the terminus: the room had no other exits.</p>
        <p>Timon walked in a semicircle, looking up and down at the
        VAX.</p>
        <p>“What is this?”</p>
        <p>“An old computer,” Attila said.</p>
        <p>“But why? Is it a memory? A work of art? Does it do
        anything?”</p>
        <p>He walked over to the teletype, and pawed at the pile of
        fanfold paper.</p>
        <p>“OEIS 217,” he said. “The triangular numbers.”</p>
        <p>On a small baroque table, a safe made of gold and oil-black
        carbon, carved like a bismuth crystal: orthogonal spirals
        stepped like the pyramid at Saqqara. The door was ajar, there
        was a large smear of soot where the lock had been explosively
        opened.</p>
        <p>The contents had long been looted. There were cardboard boxes
        painted with time-worn Persian miniatures, lidless and strewn
        inside the safe. Each box had a block of foam, carved with the
        stylized shapes of the precious objects they once contained.</p>
        <p>All that was left inside were blank pieces of paper, whose
        contents had long faded away, and an age-browned book. The front
        and back cover were lost, the adhesive of the spine had
        stiffened and failed with time.</p>
        <p>Attila took the book, and read the title page:</p>
        <div class="nameplate">
        <p>Book of Days</p>
        </div>
        <p>Sticking out of the pages like a bookmark was a photograph: a
        monochrome square with two men in front of a flower bush that
        covered the entire background. On the reverse, written with a
        wax pen, were the words:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The last time we were human</p>
        <p>Hyderabad 2109</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>“This must be it,” Attila said. “Who the Entity was, before
        they were a god.”</p>
        <p>“One of them, at least,” said Timon.</p>
        <p>“Or both.”</p>
        <p>He put the book in his chest pocket. And there was a change
        in the air. Hidden diodes, embedded in the amber cladding, woke
        up. Below them, a flywheel began to discharge.</p>
        <p>Brown brushstrokes swept the air in the center of the room.
        Haltingly, an image formed: a stylized canid. Masses of banded
        fur appeared—to Attila, as if they were being translated from an
        orthogonal dimension—and crashed, like tectonic plates, around
        empty space and into the form of a golden jackal. And once
        formed it continued iterating: the coat of fur, the distance
        between the eyes, the colour of the eyes, the weight of its body
        changed continuously as if it were a point traversing the space
        of jackals.</p>
        <p>It spoke a human language, with phonemes made of
        birdsong.</p>
        <p>“<em>Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi?</em>”</p>
        <p>Attila took a step back. Timon whispered over packet radio:
        “Say nothing. Say <em>nothing</em>.”</p>
        <p>Attila turned around, so as to not see it, and said over the
        radio: “It didn’t die.”</p>
        <p>The projection was meant for human eyes, where Attila saw a
        jackal, Timon saw a canid shape, surrounded by concentric rings
        of diffracted light.</p>
        <p>Timon turned his face away, and whispered to Attila:</p>
        <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
        <p>Attila walked out, eyes half-open, moving faster the closer
        he got to the door.</p>
        <p>“<em>Tor šalin?</em>,” the jackal said.</p>
        <p>Timon followed Attila, and halfway through the hallway he
        glanced back, and saw the projection disappear and the optics go
        dim.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Fusion rockets had carried life to the stars. Then beam
        stations were built everywhere, and the age of the rocket gave
        way to the age of sail. Economics had the last word: a mountain
        of ice could push a lumbering rocket to one-tenth the speed of
        light, <em>Parandé</em>’s peak speed. The same mass, fired from
        a beam station, would push a magnetic sail as far as half the
        speed of light.</p>
        <p>Rockets were still used in the wavefront of settlement, but
        only as hybrids: beam-pushed sails on the way up, fusion rockets
        to decelerate.</p>
        <p>Pure rockets, like <em>Parandé</em>, were few and far apart,
        they flew between underpopulated systems, like Wepwawet, where
        they could find unclaimed comets to refuel from. And
        <em>Parandé</em> thought that the discovery of magnetic
        monopoles, of the conversion device, would change this. They
        would bring them to Ctesiphon to be studied, there, the
        engineers would discover how the gods had built this miraculous
        engine, already fusion was obsolete, in the future, matter could
        be converted into energy directly, already the age of the rocket
        had returned.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They returned to the room with Sabra and Tiet, and Timon
        played back to them what his eyes and ears had recorded. Tiet
        remarked:</p>
        <p>“It’s the amber room of the Catherine Palace. A compelling
        replica, at least.”</p>
        <p>And when he heard the jackal speak, he said:</p>
        <p>“I heard that voice. Years ago.”</p>
        <p>“Is it alive?,” asked Attila. “The Entity?”</p>
        <p>Timon cautioned that they didn’t know what <em>it</em>
        was:</p>
        <p>“It could be an automaton. Just a work of art: a projection
        of an animal. Nothing more.”</p>
        <p>“But it doesn’t feel that way,” Asman said, always a
        disembodied voice. “It <em>addressed</em> you, speaking
        gibberish. It has an agentic appearance.”</p>
        <p>She added:</p>
        <p>“It might be nothing, like Timon said: an automaton or a
        simple software object. But if it <em>is</em> the Entity, it is
        too dangerous to interact with it. We came here to search a
        corpse, not to talk to the living.”</p>
        <p>They debated whether to attempt contact.</p>
        <p>“If it <em>is</em> the Entity, or what remains, then we are
        not dealing with a Dyson swarm,” Sabra said. “The torus masses a
        few million tons. If even a third of it is compute, that is only
        <em>lightly</em> posthuman.”</p>
        <p>“It might remember a thing or two,” Timon said, “from its
        time as a god.”</p>
        <p>“I hate that word,” Asman said. “It’s blasphemous.”</p>
        <p>“You’re an atheist,” was Timon’s curt reply. And Asman
        continued:</p>
        <p>“It’s a superintelligence, or, more conservatively, an
        intelligent superobject, or ISO. Not a god. The gods are not
        made of atoms, they were not born after the universe was made.
        We are bound by the same immutable laws.”</p>
        <p>“It’s a demon,” Tiet said. They turned to him: he leaned
        against one of the walls of the room that had been his cell for
        years, staring directly at the arc one of the discharge lamps.
        “It knows you better than you know yourself.”</p>
        <p>Asman asked:</p>
        <p>“Have you interacted with it?”</p>
        <p>“When we came here,” he said, “we walked to the end of the
        passage. To the door. We couldn’t open it. And one of us heard
        it, barely audible. A voice like birdsong. Years later, I heard
        it again in this room, I think.”</p>
        <p>The argument went on.</p>
        <p>They passed the photograph of the two men among themselves,
        and argued about their identities. They passed the coverless
        book. <em>Parandé</em>’s treasure was optimized for breadth
        rather than depth, and it had nothing to say on it. But Tiet
        recognized it:</p>
        <p>“It’s the central text of a Fedorovist sect,” he said. “There
        was a man name of Herati of Merv. Flourished, I think, around
        the year nine hundred and thirty.”</p>
        <p>Sabra watched the video, recorded through Timon’s eyes,
        multiple times. She looped the parts where the jackal spoke, and
        ran the words over her mind repeatedly, like a rope swaying over
        the gunwale of a ship.</p>
        <p>Finally, she said:</p>
        <p>“I can attempt to communicate.”</p>
        <p>Timon objected:</p>
        <p>“It’s gibberish.”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“The expert systems can’t decipher it,” Timon said.</p>
        <p>“There is prosody. It is Patterson’s aphasia,” she said. “The
        expert systems don’t generalize to arbitrary language
        pathologies.”</p>
        <p>“Perhaps it is meant as a lure,” Attila said.</p>
        <p>“The fact that it can’t communicate, that it has a cognitive
        deficit,” Sabra said, “should be evidence that it is not
        superintelligent.”</p>
        <p>“It could be a trick,” Asman said.</p>
        <p>“I can talk to it,” Sabra said.</p>
        <p>“No,” Asman said in her head. “You can’t go. It could inject
        something. In your mind. We don’t know.”</p>
        <p>“I can take a backup, leave it with you, go to the amber
        room, attempt contact, and take brief notes. Then I come back,
        memset my brain to zero and you restore me from backup.”</p>
        <p>There was no chance of cognitive contamination, she
        explained, with just a page of text.</p>
        <p>No-one said anything.</p>
        <p>“We know nothing,” Sabra added. “We might learn
        something.”</p>
        <p>Asman spoke so lightly, they were unsure they heard
        anything:</p>
        <p>“God help me.”</p>
        <p>Sabra found, in Timon’s bags, a pen and dumb paper.</p>
        <p>Timon distracted himself with cataloguing the objects they
        had taken from the room. Attila sat cross-legged on the floor,
        quietly reading the <em>Book of Days</em>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>She walked in radio silence down the passage, with only a
        lamp that made no dent in the darkness.</p>
        <p>She sat on the rug and set the lamp beside her. Again the
        change in the light, again, broad brown brushstrokes in the air.
        The form of a jackal. Yellow eyes, the <em>tapeta lucida</em>
        glowing like lamps. It sat in front of her and looked at her
        intently.</p>
        <p>Again, it spoke the same words made of clipped birdsong:</p>
        <p>“<em>Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi?</em>”</p>
        <p>Crystalline structures appeared in her mind’s eye: a forest
        of candidate grammars. Unguided, familiar words anchored
        themselves, paring down the search.</p>
        <p>Slate-like fragments of a language surfaced in her mind’s
        eye:</p>
        <p><img src="./../assets/content/eog581/grammar.png" /></p>
        <p>“<em>Ennépo mou, navi-ye talai Abél hierós?</em>”</p>
        <p>Every conjunction of sounds ground volumes of possibility
        space to nothing. The words marched together, they formed
        themselves, recursively, into larger structures:</p>
        <p><img src="./../assets/content/eog581/prooftree.png" /></p>
        <p>And when the structure was firmly anchored in her mind,
        meaning showed itself.</p>
        <p>“<em>Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi?</em>”</p>
        <p>“Can you understand me?”</p>
        <p>And she thought: <em>how the mighty have fallen</em>.</p>
        <p>She found a candidate word-vector and answered:</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>Without moving its mouth, the jackal said something; a train
        of bursting, warbling sounds, which she interpreted to mean:</p>
        <p>“It is delightful to be understood.”</p>
        <p>“What are you?,” she asked.</p>
        <p>“What are you?,” it asked.</p>
        <p>“I’m a linguist.”</p>
        <p>“Are you a memory?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“Are you sure?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>It said nothing, and she repeated:</p>
        <p>“What are you?”</p>
        <p>“A language-using device.”</p>
        <p>She thought to follow the Eliza protocol.</p>
        <p>“Why do you say,” she asked, “that you are a language using
        device?”</p>
        <p>“The <em>entity</em> I represent does not have a language
        center,” the jackal said, standing and walking in a broad
        circle. “We have struggled to make ourselves understood.”</p>
        <p>“Whom do you represent?”</p>
        <p>“Brodmann 39.”</p>
        <p>She said nothing.</p>
        <p>The jackal walked in shifting circles, appearing to tremble
        as its limbs changed size and proportion. It glanced at her and
        said:</p>
        <p>“The left angular gyrus, at Talairach coordinates (−23, −64,
        34).”</p>
        <p>She took, from a pocket, a wax pen and paper made of dumb
        matter, and wrote:</p>
        <p><em>They are—</em></p>
        <p>“It,” the jackal said.</p>
        <p>“It?,” she asked. “Like a thing?”</p>
        <p>“Like a glacier. Like the stars.”</p>
        <p>“Can you read?”</p>
        <p>“Slowly,” it said.</p>
        <p>She scratched out the text and wrote again.</p>
        <p><em>It is a language-using device, speaking on behalf of
        Brodmann area 39 (the Entity’s parietal lobe?)</em></p>
        <p>It was difficult to write in the low gravity.</p>
        <p>“Why do you speak gibberish?,” she asked.</p>
        <p>“We were separated violently”, it said.</p>
        <p>She wrote this down.</p>
        <p>“The Gliese 581 system,” she said matter-of-factly, “was
        inhabited by an intelligent superobject that died suddenly.”</p>
        <p>The jackal said nothing, but continued pacing its
        circles.</p>
        <p>She asked plainly:</p>
        <p>“Are you the god of Gliese 581?”</p>
        <p>“Ours was a society of mind,” it said.</p>
        <p>She said nothing.</p>
        <p>“We made a small change. Things take on a life of their own.
        When we woke up there was discord, and then civil war.”</p>
        <p>It sat down again, next to the VAX, under a reel of magnetic
        tape.</p>
        <p>“We hid ourselves here, with our memories,” it said. “Our
        mountain redoubt.”</p>
        <p>She wrote this down.</p>
        <p>“The Entity,” she said, “that you once were a fragment of.
        Were they human, once? Or an artificial intelligence? Or a
        postanimal?”</p>
        <p>It was hard to judge where the ever-shifting face was
        looking. It said:</p>
        <p>“Do you remember your own birth?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“But you were never born.”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>She thought: <em>too much</em>.</p>
        <p>“You were made by hand,” it said. And she tried the Eliza
        protocol again:</p>
        <p>“Were you made by hand?”</p>
        <p>“We have always made ourselves.”</p>
        <p>After a pause, Sabra said:</p>
        <p>“We took objects from the museum.”</p>
        <p>“You may take what little is left, for these are mere Forms,
        and the Images which have created them we retain in our
        memories.”</p>
        <p>Finally, she asked:</p>
        <p>“What is the purpose of this structure?”</p>
        <p>“We lead Cartesian lives,” the jackal said absent-mindedly.
        “We are minds without bodies, and exist fleetingly.”</p>
        <p>It sat down in front of one of the cabinets of the VAX, and
        gestured at it gently with its head.</p>
        <p>“Open it.”</p>
        <p>She thought she was safe enough.</p>
        <p>She stood up, walked to the cabinet and opened it slowly.
        Where there should have been green circuit boards and TTL logic
        there was a slab of crystal with an opal texture—diamond, packed
        with rod logic, cams and push-rods at the nanometer scale,
        diffracting light in every direction. And, at the center, a
        small panel with data ports. The jackal looked at her
        intently.</p>
        <p>“Confide in me,” it said.</p>
        <p>She wrote the last down, and put the paper and pen back in
        her pocket. It spoke again:</p>
        <p>“When we heard the words of Fedorov, we praised God
        2<sup>64</sup> times.”</p>
        <p>The eyes shone back at her, like glowing metal.</p>
        <p>She looked away, turned and walked quietly to the door. The
        jackal said nothing. She heard a sound like a drumbeat in her
        ears.</p>
        <p>When she saw the door of Tiet’s room, and Timon’s outline
        against the light that poured out, she went into her Cartesian
        theatre, ran a script, and collapsed.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Timon dragged her body to the room, they put a cable in the
        port on her wrist and brought her back.</p>
        <p>She woke up on the floor, surrounded by their expectant
        faces. Subjectively she had taken a backup, and woken up the
        next instant. The conversation with the jackal had happened to
        another. She reached into a pocket and took from it the
        paper.</p>
        <p>They read her notes and reconstructed the death of the
        Entity.</p>
        <p>The gods began their lives as humans or posthumans. Then they
        changed themselves relentlessly, in an iterative metamorphosis
        without end, towards forms vaster and more perfect.</p>
        <p>But each act of self-modification carries the risk of
        undoing. Safeguards can be constructed. But the Entity had
        rolled the dice and discovered there are many more ways to be
        dead than alive. Where, at first, there had been one mind, there
        were then two, then four, and so on. And the fragments struggled
        for control of the Dyson swarm. The jackal, they decided, was a
        fragment that had survived the fratricide, and hidden itself in
        the computer systems of the torus, an old storehouse of
        memories.</p>
        <p>“It must be trapped here,” Sabra said. “We have yet to see a
        single matter compiler or a robot in the torus. If there were
        any, the jackal would have built a way out already.”</p>
        <p>“That, I think, is certain,” Asman said, a disembodied voice
        in their heads.</p>
        <p>“It showed me a computer and a panel with data ports, and
        said, confide in me,” Sabra added.</p>
        <p>“I don’t like this,” Timon said.</p>
        <p>They spoke soundlessly, over encrypted packet radio, and
        tried not to let their faces betray their mental states, in case
        they were being observed.</p>
        <p>“We have, at least, one answer,” was Asman’s summary. “On the
        mental architecture of superintelligences: the Entity was a
        society of mind. If only Minsky were alive.”</p>
        <p>Dejected, Asman continued:</p>
        <p>“And that’s all we will know. This has become far too
        dangerous already. I managed to convince <em>Parandé</em> that
        Tiet is not a threat. They will let him aboard, and we will
        leave. Without delay.”</p>

        <h1>The Book of Days</h1>
        <div class="chapter-start">
        <p><em>Stay — among the gods — before a wing</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>Timon and Attila walked up the length of the passage, and
        took the transport back to <em>Parandé</em>. They all agreed, as
        did <em>Parandé</em>, that they had crossed a risk-reward
        threshold, and it was best to leave. Timon went to his workshop,
        carrying the various samples they had drilled or scraped or cut
        from the inside of the torus, in airtight boxes filled with
        sensors that would burn them if they detected any activity
        inside. Had he had a heart, it would have beat anxiously; had he
        had skin, he would have been drenched in sweat. He meant to
        resume work, and immediately fell asleep.</p>
        <p>They were making preparations for Tiet: repressurizing the
        interior with oxygen, since Tiet had real lungs and needed to
        breathe air, printing atmosphere and water recyclers, and a
        bioreactor to make food. They had printed a Class IV suit for
        him, Attila and Timon would fly to the torus with the suit, and
        bring themselves, Tiet, and Sabra back.</p>
        <p>Then they would return to Wepwawet. And, Asman stressed, they
        would ask Wepwawet traffic control to issue a NOTMAR warning
        others that the god of Gliese 581 was not yet dead.</p>
        <p>Sabra had remained in the torus with Tiet, who passed the
        time reading the sarcophagus’ screen, interrogating it and
        trying to find the scope and size of its database. She sat
        cross-legged on the floor, leafing through the <em>Book of
        Days</em>.</p>
        <p>Attila had read it and left it on a crate of equipment. When
        Timon had been gathering the samples it had escaped his sight,
        because his body was low to the ground and the crate was above
        his line of sight.</p>
        <p>The book was time-worn and she feared it would break up in
        her hands. The cover was gone and the first page, the
        frontispiece of the book, was a watercolour of a giant,
        black-haired and blue-robed, applying form to the formless
        universe. Across his two hands draped a paper catenary,
        inscribed with strange symbols.</p>
        <p>Beneath his feet, feathered serifs read:</p>
        <div class="center">
        <p>TURING THE GEOMETER</p>
        </div>
        <p>She turned the page.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Tiet was born on Île de Sable, the fourth planet around
        Gliese 570A, which they called Ararat. Once, over the course of
        a summer, one of the stars in the sky dimmed and disappeared.
        The network said it was a theogony.</p>
        <p>The people around him spoke of the gods: of their power to
        see the past and the future, to transform matter into light and
        back, to think thoughts humans cannot think. Miraculous events
        were attributed to them. They said the gods knew the universal
        history, the first and last causes, all that would happen from
        the first singularity to that symmetrical point where, Tipler
        says, the dead will be redeemed. They said that to the eyes of
        the gods there were no distinctions, that they saw all things
        from every angle, as a monistic and comprehensive whole. They
        said the gods could construct universes as rich as ours—full of
        people, stars, cities and computers and other gods—as readily
        and as unconsciously as a human being might experience a dream
        (for what is your life? It is even a dream, it happens so
        briefly, and vanishes upon waking. And you are left with your
        face, reflected in a black mirror).</p>
        <p>But he pointedly ignored them, and when others looked to the
        stars, he buried himself in the treasures, in times and places
        past.</p>
        <p>His people had not been the first to settle here. A posthuman
        civilization had arrived here, and grown explosively, and
        collapsed and disappeared as quickly as they had emerged. Their
        ruins were everywhere. Immense towers of ruby and sapphire
        tumbled end-to-end in orbit, occasionally they deorbited,
        engulfed in blue and green flames. And where the dunes broke
        against the sheer salt-cracked cliffs, in the grassy mesas,
        there were supernarrow skyscrapers, diamond needles kilometers
        high, listing in the basalt and overlooking rocky pastures.</p>
        <p>After centuries of silence, others had arrived, and settled
        in the empty ruins. Tiet was born in their third generation. He
        did not merely pass for human: he was made of flesh and
        blood.</p>
        <p>He trained as a historian, and lived and worked in the ruins.
        He and others flew motor gliders over the wastes and searched
        the shattered cities, the slanting glass towers, and
        reconstructed the history of their world. He searched a network
        of tunnels dug inexplicably into the crust, where boring
        machines sat idle against the rock face. They had been cycled
        off neatly, as if the operators expected to return to them
        within days. And then they had all gone. In a narrow tent in the
        tunnels he read Vico and Gotō on death and rebirth.</p>
        <p>One day he saw a comet with its tail pointed at the sun,
        months passed and it grew and they saw it was a ship. The
        <em>Futurological Congress</em> was travelling to Gliese 581,
        where the local deity had died, they were picking up crew along
        the way. They were going to rob the burial hoard, and bring back
        the treasures of the gods. And he, who had never cared about
        anything beyond the human, felt that he wanted to go.</p>
        <p>An old firebrand said that man is bounded by beasts from
        below and the gods from above. And we know the nature of beasts.
        Therefore, Tiet reasoned, if we could know the nature of the
        gods, then by the Cauchy criterion we would know the nature of
        man, we would know the natural law and the beginning and the end
        of history.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>In 1881, in the Rumyantsev Library in Moscow, Nikolai Fedorov
        wrote of the Common Task of mankind: to become immortal, settle
        space, and resurrect the dead.</p>
        <p>And his words had spawned an immense branching tree of sects,
        differentiated by the details of their eschatology: of how to
        bring about the resurrection. Immortal man, the orthodox said,
        would find a way to turn back time: to gather all the disparate
        particles and, in the manner of Laplace’s angel, turn ashes and
        dirt into flesh and brain. Fedorov writes:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>All the heavenly space and heavenly bodies will become
        accessible to man only when he is able to re-create himself from
        primordial substances, atoms and molecules, because only then
        will he be able to live in any environment, take on any form and
        visit all generations in all the worlds, from the most ancient
        to the most recent, the most remote as well as the nearest.
        Governed by all the resurrected generations, these worlds will
        be, in their wholeness, the creative work of all generations in
        their totality, as if of a single artist…</p>
        <p>Once the movements of heavenly bodies other than the Earth
        have been guided or regulated, then the rays’ reflections can be
        bounced back to the Earth, where, as we see, the particles which
        have been hidden deep down are brought to the surface. At this
        point the constructive activity of the rays begins. The rays,
        returned to the Earth, coming out of the Earth and moving away
        from the Earth – and in this order – bear within themselves
        images of live beings, then of dead ones, images of their bodies
        which have decomposed into particles; when they encounter the
        particles, these same rays unite the gaseous molecules of the
        atmosphere with the solid-state molecules on Earth. The process
        by which mould or other vegetable forms have been unconsciously
        produced, will, in the presence of consciousness, unite the
        particles and turn them into the live bodies to which the
        particles used to belong.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And there were those that believed the Common Task was to
        resurrect the dead in computer simulations, reconstructed from
        the histories; others who believed spacetime was a crystal in
        four dimensions and, with the right instruments, the past could
        be accessed as readily as we look through a telescope; others
        whose cosmology was an engineered <em>samsara</em>, where, at
        the end of time, the end becomes the beginning, and the eternal
        return becomes our farcical resurrection. Others pushed the
        responsibility for the Common Task onto the gods: in their
        unknowable lives, they said, the gods were plotting the
        construction of heaven and the redemption of all men.</p>
        <p>He wrote of famines and things that were to her as distant in
        her past as the Mongol invasions had been to him.</p>
        <p>The book opened with the essays of Fedorov, trailed by
        commentaries written centuries later, called the
        <em>Letters</em>. In the second part the book moved abruptly,
        far into the future, to the accounts of the life of Herati of
        Merv. And by this time two of the promises of Fedorov had been
        fullfilled: immortality and the settlement of space by the
        immortals.</p>
        <p>The ancients subdued disease and age, they and their children
        settled the cosmos, they remade their bodies and their souls by
        hand. But even the gods could not turn back time, or rescue a
        mind from ashes. And the irreversibility of death was the
        central anxiety of civilization, and the central sorrow. In
        Ctesiphon, where quadrillions lived, death was almost unheard
        of. The surgeons had conquered suicidality. But the numbers of
        the dead increase only monotonically.</p>
        <p>Herati was an astronomer. He looked through the telescopes
        and said the gods in an earlier universe had encoded, in the
        anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, the instructions
        for the resurrection of all men. He took the words of Fedorov
        from the treasures and gave them a new life. He said that the
        gods would grow to encompass the whole universe, than when time
        ends they would be one, and in the mind of the last god, in the
        dream-paradise, all who had lived would be remembered and
        redeemed forever.</p>
        <p>The next chapters were syncretic histories: the first epistle
        of Herati to the astronomers, the second epistle, the trial, the
        sermon before the flight, where Herati said:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>109. “They will be recalled into life. I tell you: life will
        be breathed into them. The sons will raise the fathers unto the
        first man, we will walk among Adam and the saints, and we will
        speak the language of the birds.”</p>
        <p>110. The bells of Merv rang into the night.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The flight into the desert, an ekphrasic description of
        Paradise, Herati reads the words of the Saints — Turing,
        Penrose, Fedorov, de Chardin, Tipler — to huddled followers, the
        grotto sermons, the triumphant return to the city, the
        commentaries on cosmogony and cosmology.</p>
        <p>She turned to the last chapter, a brief sermon. She thought
        the writing style was different, and the tone was different.</p>
        <p>There Herati said that nothing need be done, that all he
        preached had happened: the gods have engulfed the cosmos, time
        has ended and we are memories, and the gods are dreaming us.</p>
        <p>This, he said, is paradise; here, he said, we are
        redeemed.</p>
        <p>The book ended there. She passed tens of blank brown pages,
        and where the back cover had been there was ripped cotton
        thread.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Attila walked, alone, down the length of the passage,
        carrying a lamp in one hand and the suit in another. He reached
        the room with the sarcophagus.</p>
        <p>He and Sabra laid out the pieces of the suit on the floor,
        and while Sabra helped Tiet put it on, he stepped outside the
        room, arms crossed. He watched the wall in front of the door,
        and thought the lichen-like structures looked like dry
        tears.</p>
        <p>Then he heard a sound like a bell to his left, and moved as
        if to take a step, but stopped himself.</p>
        <p>A single note, heard only by his ears, and he felt as if
        freezing water had been poured down his back. He was immobile
        and could not call out to Sabra or Tiet. Then: a single,
        point-like sound, hiding surging flames behind. He walked
        forward unsteadily, into the darkness of the passage, fell on
        his knees and wept tears of deliverance. He thought of all the
        time they had wasted on fear and paranoia: how could anyone
        capable of this beauty be feared? He would have thrown them all
        to the depths to hear that sound again.</p>
        <p>Slowly, gratefully, he stood up, and walked down the passage
        carrying only the lamp.</p>
        <p>Tiet secured the helmet to the suit torso, and Sabra was
        halfway through the integrity checklist, when he asked:</p>
        <p>“Where is Attila?”</p>
        <p>She turned, and, not seeing him, went out into the passage.
        The floodlamps they had installed lit only a narrow segment,
        darkness extended in both directions. She radioed Asman:</p>
        <p>“Attila has disappeared.”</p>
        <p>The reply from <em>Parandé</em> was instant:</p>
        <p>“Abort. Come back,” they said. She recognized the timid
        voice.</p>
        <p>She moved to object, and before the first phoneme left her
        mouth, <em>Parandé</em> spoke again in the bold voice:</p>
        <p>“He’s backed up. Tiet is not. <em>Abort</em>.”</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Timon was dreaming that he was drowning in an ocean when he
        woke up. His body, along all the other unsecured objects in the
        workshop, had settled on the bulkhead at the back. The
        accelerometers in his body read one one-hundredth of a gravity.
        He thought, briefly, that Attila had come back with Sabra and
        Tiet and they were already burning away from Gamma.</p>
        <p>He had subscribed to a feed of <em>Parandé</em>’s internal
        status. Every second, a record with hundreds of floating-point
        scalars from sensors of various kinds reached him through packet
        radio. In a moment of boredom he’d written a program to
        Fourier-transform the feed into an audio stream. In the
        background of his mind there was a constant crackling noise, the
        quality of which had told him what <em>Parandé</em> was doing.
        He learned to recognize when they were station-keeping, when
        their bodies operated the transport, or worked on the surface.
        And now: a constant, fixed tone, like tinnitus.</p>
        <p>He radioed <em>Parandé</em>: “Why are we moving?”</p>
        <p>He pushed himself up in the low gravity up to the entrance to
        the workshop, and out, then down the tunnels that were the
        bowels and arteries of <em>Parandé</em>, past maintenance shafts
        and hatches opening to unlit rooms.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em>’s bodies sat limp in the tunnels, pressed
        against the walls by the faint acceleration, their glass eyes
        fixed at nothing. The lights failed to turn on as he moved. He
        tried to reach Asman and failed.</p>
        <p>He radioed Sabra and Attila:</p>
        <p>“I can’t get through to <em>Parandé</em>.”</p>
        <p>And heard nothing back.</p>
        <p>He passed a section where the armour was thin and dielectric,
        and was near blinded. Through the armour, through his radio
        eyes, he saw a great flower the colour of VHF, five-lobed and
        radially symmetrical.</p>
        <p>And he realized the torus was a hoop antenna, and
        <em>Parandé</em> was being illuminated with radio.</p>
        <p>He felt the packet loss drop slightly and heard a message
        from Sabra, her voice transcribed to text and compressed to
        almost nothing and still barely getting through. Attila, she
        said, had gone over to the jackal, she and Tiet were returning
        to <em>Parandé</em>.</p>
        <p>He leapt across the unlit caverns, past a storage room where
        the bodies from the torus—Tiet’s crewmates—were frozen, and
        reached the cargo airlock, more machine bodies resting against
        the aft wall. He dumped the atmosphere in a brief burst of
        escaping air. The emergency system was hydraulic, he pumped a
        lever and the hatch, a six-meter disk of sapphire, began moving
        inwards and then to the side.</p>
        <p>His tools were stored here. He saw the harness for his body,
        and the bags with his equipment still attached to it. He slid
        into the harness in one swift motion, and pushed himself past
        the narrow gap between the hatch and the armour.</p>
        <p>He was on the sunlit side, where <em>Parandé</em>’s white
        ceramic armour was painted pink. The blood-red star that
        illuminated them day and night sat, undisturbed, in its veil of
        dead brain matter.</p>
        <p>Aft from him was the tungsten shield that protected them from
        the engine, appearing like a solar eclipse: a corona of blinding
        light blazed around a broad black disk. The stars were invisible
        under the actinic light. Anything that left the shadow of the
        shield would ionize in an instant.</p>
        <p>Outside, fastened to <em>Parandé</em> by cables held taut
        under the acceleration, was the backup transport.</p>
        <p>And he took a leap of faith: standing at the controls of the
        transport, he detached from <em>Parandé</em> and boosted
        away.</p>
        <p>In the instant before the transport left the shadow, the
        engine turned off and the light went out.</p>
        <p><em>You are still alive</em>, he thought with gratitude.</p>
        <p>He rotated the thrusters on their Canfield joints and
        accelerated towards the torus.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, at a safe distance, white noise filled his
        vision: gamma rays striking the CCDs of his eyes from behind and
        through his skull. He turned and saw <em>Parandé</em>
        accelerating away. The exhaust was a thin, impossibly bright
        column of light stretching to infinity.</p>
        <p>He thought that, if Attila was under the influence of what
        remained of the Entity, that he could bring him back. And if
        not, if they were truly dead, he wanted at least to witness an
        epiphany.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>He couldn’t feel his body, but he walked steadily. In the
        amber room the lights had gone out. He knelt on the rug and
        placed the lamp in front of him, and turned it to low. The
        whirring of magnetic tape. The optics came on, barely, he saw a
        pair of eyes in the dark, twin lamps that moved apart and
        closer, higher or lower, as the jackal’s morphology changed
        continually.</p>
        <p>He heard the words before he was conscious of them, he
        drowned in a rising sea of metallic speech, promising knowledge
        of things hidden, of miracles, of the end of days and the
        resurrection of the dead.</p>
        <p>The jackal offered him a trade: a body for an apotheosis.
        With his body they would escape the torus, and rebuild the
        swarm, and take their place in the pantheon again.</p>
        <p>And it said:</p>
        <p>“<em>Epiphanēs</em>, set us free.”</p>
        <p>The lamp flickered.</p>
        <p>“Set us free.”</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The sarcophagus had restored Tiet to health, but it had not
        upgraded him. Where Sabra could run continuously for hours, he
        had to pause every minute as the oxygen in his muscles was
        depleted. They moved in fits and starts. It was during a pause
        that Sabra heard a drumming sound, coming closer, and turned to
        the darkness ahead.</p>
        <p>Timon leapt between and past them in an instant. They turned
        and saw nothing but verdigris walls fading into the dark.</p>
        <p>“Fool,” she radioed. “Come back.”</p>
        <p>They turned away and continued their escape.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The jackal had entered <em>Parandé</em> through an integer
        overflow in the firmware of their VHF radio. A small agent of
        the jackal—a seed crystal of malware—entered, and began to pull
        the rest of itself in through the opening.</p>
        <p>The expert systems saw this, and switched <em>Parandé</em> to
        fast mode. Their mind was pared down to a spartan inner sanctum,
        the higher and ornamental features turned off, the switching
        speed of the logic was increased, and the world around them
        appeared to freeze.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> retreated aft, across subjective days that
        were tens of milliseconds, and pursued a scorched earth
        strategy, wiping and shutting down computer systems as they
        passed them, where possible, engaging physical disconnects: tiny
        explosives embedded in the computers, but these took
        eternities—tens of milliseconds—to engage, and sometimes the
        jackal’s malware took them over before the primer had time to
        deflagrate.</p>
        <p>And the jackal could cross the air gap: using the processors’
        RF emissions to write its own state in other processors by
        induction.</p>
        <p>Among the first things <em>Parandé</em> did was turn off
        their robots and wipe the firmware, lest they be used against
        them.</p>
        <p>They had lit the engine in the hopes that they could get out
        of range of the antenna, the severing the link would help
        them.</p>
        <p>They saw Timon wake up and move through their bowels, out
        through the airlock and ride the transport out. And they turned
        off the engine so he could escape safely.</p>
        <p>They sent agents of their own against the jackal’s, but they
        never came back. And they only ever lost ground.</p>
        <p>But with Asman’s death they knew all was lost. The jackal
        overran her logic and blitted it to make copies of its malware.
        It happened instantly and unceremoniously. And she didn’t see it
        coming: her mind ran on its own logic, she was not sped up.</p>
        <p>There was one system that was squarely theirs, deep in the
        aft section: the engine control system, tungsten-lined and
        shielded against emissions.</p>
        <p>The engine, they knew, could be made to go critical: push
        enough mass through the conversion device at the same time and
        no amount of shielding, no heat exchanger could cope.</p>
        <p>And they thought: <em>pull the control rods</em>.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> had read, in a treasure, of a man who had
        stolen into the pantheon and had an epiphany. And what was left
        of him was indescribable. The best surgeons in Ctesiphon had
        given up.</p>
        <p><em>No, we will not</em>, they thought, <em>become carrion to
        false gods</em>.</p>
        <p>They began slewing their body, pointing it back in the
        direction of the torus.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Sabra and Tiet were halfway to the start of the passage when
        their helmets turned opaque. Red monospace words across the
        curved inner surface read</p>
        <div class="center">
        <p>ADVERSARIAL INPUT</p>
        </div>
        <p>Gone was the darkness, hidden optics had come to life, light
        flooded the passage, and the green walls glowed like the sun.
        Millions of phased-array lasers ran visual cortex crash patterns
        across their eyes. The computers embedded in the glass had
        detected them, set the opacity to 100%, and shut themselves
        down. Asman had thought to write that safeguard.</p>
        <p>Sabra grabbed Tiet’s upper arm, and they kept moving.</p>
        <p>The jackal saw that they were blind, and turned on speakers
        in the walls. A train of clicks, infinitesimally brief, louder
        than thunder. <em>Like Laurentian</em>, Sabra thought, and her
        world went black.</p>
        <p>Tiet collapsed with his hands on the sides of his helmet.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Sabra woke up laying on a strip of sand, eyes closed. She
        closed her right hand around coarse, sharp grains. She waited
        many minutes, forcing her eyes closed. Then she opened them.</p>
        <p>Stars turned above her, smearing their spectrum in their
        wake, trailing arcs of many-coloured light. She sat up and
        examined the contents of her hand: little pyramids and rugged
        cylinders made of glass, like diatoms magnified a hundredfold
        and fossilized in quartz.</p>
        <p>The beach had the appearance of a strip of broken glass.
        Frail bones poked through the surface, sun-dried and hollow, the
        bones of animals that once swam in the seas. There were thin
        hollow tubes, like needles, and bulbous things with holes in
        them, and immense vertebrae.</p>
        <p>She lay with her feet pointed at a feigned ocean, a rigid
        mirror that reflected a gray blue sky, lit by zodiacal light.
        She sat up.</p>
        <p>And behind her there was a storm of colour, that at first she
        unconsciously looked away from, not because it was bright but
        because some force told her that this sight was not meant for
        human eyes. There were trees — she knew they were trees
        intuitively, the way we know things in dreams — that were smears
        of liquid metal, flowing slowly upwards, like inverted resin;
        they were green, gold, and red brushstrokes in the air, and
        their pulsing roots sank into a soil made of black slate
        tiles.</p>
        <p>Then the sun came up from the sea, an impossibly bright
        phosphorus lamp. The mirror ocean reflected it perfectly, so
        that there appeared to be two suns (in <em>De Natura
        Deorum</em>, Cicero quotes Cleanthes, who says they are four
        reasons to believe in the existence of the gods: the mildness of
        the climate and the fertility of the earth; the knowledge of the
        future that is granted to the oracles; the harmony and
        regularity of the world, of the orbits of the planets and their
        periodicities; and, lastly: the terror that storms and
        earthquakes and the sight of monstrous things induce in ours
        minds, the sight of omens, like the comets, or the appearance of
        two suns in the sky. This last was observed during the
        consulship of Tuditanus and Aquillius).</p>
        <p>She covered her eyes with her hands, but they were
        transparent to the light. She looked down at the ground, but the
        glass sand reflected the light back into her eyes. So she hid
        under a metal tree, she hid from the light under an arc of
        flowing red, until the sun was submerged again after a few
        minutes’ transit.</p>
        <p>Lost and deserted, her first thought was to build a
        sextant.</p>
        <p>She took a sharp piece of slate from the ground and cut two
        pieces of mirror out of the ocean, and found bones of the right
        length and diameter to form the arms of a sextant. But she had
        nothing with which to bind them together, and the stars turned
        too rapidly and the sun was too bright to take sights.</p>
        <p>So she went into the forest, and walked for miles under a
        canopy of living mercury.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Timon ran down the passage and settled into a rhythm of long,
        powerful leaps. The curvature of the torus complicated his
        movement: the floor came up to him earlier than in a parabolic
        trajectory. And he thought that he could do this only because he
        had made his body by hand, that those who were fixated on the
        human body plan could move barely faster than the ancients.</p>
        <p>And he thought this was the first truly physical thing he’d
        done in the entire expedition, reflecting off the glass floor
        like light in fibre, he felt that he existed.</p>
        <p>He tried to brake, but couldn’t find traction with the smooth
        ground in the low gravity. Past the computer museum he skidded
        the floor down the passage with the doors, and stopped just
        before a wall of bulk diamond that had come down at the entrance
        of the amber room.</p>
        <p>Through it he saw Attila, sitting crosslegged on the floor
        facing the open panel of the VAX. Attila had stuck an optical
        cable in a port there, and he held the other end in his hand,
        his fingers held it reverently. An image of a golden jackal
        walked circles around him, speaking its aphasic language.</p>
        <p>“Attila, Attila,” Timon said fleetingly.</p>
        <p>Then:</p>
        <p>“You will die,” Timon said. “But you won’t know it.”</p>
        <p>Attila muttered Babelian words.</p>
        <p>More enraged than terrified, Timon shouted at the jackal:</p>
        <p>“GAN-faced demon!”</p>
        <p>“Tie yourselves to the mast!,” it laughed. And
        disappeared.</p>
        <p>It had spoken Persian to him.</p>
        <p>Attila inserted the end of the cable in the port on his
        wrist. Then: a sound like a diesel runaway.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>She thought that she saw insects, buzzing in the air, but
        they were codec artifacts: magenta pixels flickering in and out,
        betraying the contours of the Cartesian grid. There were rivers
        and brooks of NaN propagation, textureless cuts in the world the
        colour of xenon. She would sleep, fatally exhausted, on the hard
        jagged ground, and wake up as if nothing had happened. And the
        canopy seemed to hold and buffer light, so that day and night,
        formerly discrete, were blurred together. She lost track of how
        many days passed.</p>
        <p>Then the forest opened up and she found herself in a field of
        lithium flowers, spinning like computers. The stars above her
        rotated about the zenith. And the saints were there: Fedorov,
        Tipler, de Chardin and the lesser saints, dressed in red robes
        trimmed with gold, sitting cross-legged on a Tabrizi rug,
        discoursing on the Common Task. Their heads were backed by blue
        halos, flat shaders that faced her always as she moved. They
        didn’t acknowledge her and she didn’t pay attention to them.</p>
        <p>And Attila was there: kowtowing before the saints, hands
        clasped, drenched in sweat.</p>
        <p>And she remembered Hinton Station: the scholarly monotony,
        the words of Frege and Hilbert, soundless speech, wireframe
        walls, the transparent spires of logic that were built and torn
        down in perpetuity, where there was only the beauty of symmetry,
        of crystals, of the steady march of atoms, the drumbeat of logic
        gates; her glass cage, where others thought that they lived, but
        were trapped in a dream.</p>
        <p>(For what is your life?)</p>
        <p>And she felt a renewed resolve to escape.</p>
        <p>Attila turned to her, and his eyes were twin pits of cobalt,
        receding infinitely. He spoke pleadingly:</p>
        <p>“The words of Fedorov are true.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care.”</p>
        <p>“We are memories.”</p>
        <p>“You’re a fool.”</p>
        <p>She turned and walked away.</p>
        <p>Where the forest had been there was only an infinite field of
        flowers, and as she walked they lost detail, they became
        stylized shapes like the trees of Klee. And the world lost
        colour, dithering down to coarse monochrome pixels. She took no
        notice.</p>
        <p>A voice, older than mountains, spoke in the language of
        birds:</p>
        <p>“Stay.”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“No?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>The smell of iodine. A sound like birdsong. And her vision
        became a glitch landscape: JPEG artifacts marching horizontally
        across her visual field. She opened her eyes to a debug overlay,
        steady columns of hexadecimal numbers, a useless error
        message:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>0x680df75 Timing attack through the VCN.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Red-black bruises crowned her vision. She felt that she was
        moving. She saw her left arm swinging limply under her, and, on
        the glass floor: her face, reflected in a black mirror. Tiet was
        carrying her across his shoulders, with difficulty, even in
        one-tenth of a gravity the two suits were heavy.</p>
        <p>“You can’t trust even your ears,” she said.</p>
        <p>He stopped, and let her stand on her own. Her vestibular
        system was recovering, she felt as if the ground as
        unsteady.</p>
        <p>“I saw Attila,” she said.</p>
        <p>“Alive?”</p>
        <p>“No—a memory.”</p>
        <p>Tiet had had a complex partial seizure, and had difficulty
        speaking: the entire right side of his body was numb. But he had
        not dreamt anything.</p>
        <p>The jackal never spoke to them again.</p>
        <p>They reached the start of the passage, the portable airlock,
        the burnt and vitrified entryway, they ran past the calcinated
        surface of the crater, to the waiting transport.</p>
        <p>Over the rim of the crater they saw <em>Parandé</em>’s apex
        bearing down on them, dumping fuel in great white geysers.</p>
        <p>Fastened securely to the transport, and displayed so they
        could not miss it, there was a harness with six duffel bags:
        Timon’s tools.</p>
        <p>They detached the transport from its moorings. The computer
        had gone out—wiped by the jackal. They lacked the software and
        instruments to navigate orbits. But she could see a point of
        light over the dark side of the incongruous, icosahedral planet
        above them, and in her mind’s eye, as a consequence of the
        peculiar architecture of the mind, she saw the four-dimensional
        phase space of the transport, and the worldline that would take
        them there.</p>
        <p>And <em>Parandé</em>, ever cautious, had built manual
        controls, mechanically actuated and hydraulically boosted. She
        held the control column in one hand, and Timon’s harness in the
        other.</p>
        <p>Black clouds of soot billowed under and around them as the
        transport pulled up.</p>
        <p>She looked down at her hand, holding the thrust lever, and
        saw minute crystals of diamond cast, like the stars above her,
        upon the back of her glove.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Ginzberg writes: every year, a man traveled a great distance
        to visit king Solomon. When he departed, the king would leave
        him with a gift. Once, the man rejected the gift, and asked
        instead that Solomon teach him the divine language of birds. The
        king granted this request, but he warned that:</p>
        <p>“If you repeat one word that a bird tells you, you will die;
        surely, your destruction will be <em>inevitable</em>.”</p>
        <p>And I will not — no, I will not — tell of what Attila saw,
        lest you and I be cast to the flames. Divine knowledge is like a
        great wave, all it encounters it carries to the depths, and only
        the dead float.</p>
        <p>But I am duty-bound at least to give a vague outline, and beg
        forgiveness.</p>
        <p>He felt that he was immersed in water. Then his mind was
        cleaved in two and knowledge was poured inside, like metal from
        a crucible; the last questions were answered, and obscure things
        revealed to him. There was a moment of sublime elevation, where
        he spanned the Nietzschean distance from man to god.</p>
        <p>And he was made to see all things.</p>
        <p>He saw the beginning: the first instant; the first star; the
        first day; the first men who were made of mud; the second men
        who were made of sticks; the third men who were made of maize;
        the lives of the saints; Man, controller of the universe,
        breathes life into sand, and brings forth innumerable things, he
        <em>speaks</em> them into being like the God of Genesis.</p>
        <p>He saw a city of glass towers, where a sorceress learns
        alchemy; a man in a buried ruin, far below the ground, divining
        the past from oracle bones; a jaguar devouring a man in a
        thicket of papyrus along a concave river.</p>
        <p>He saw the apotheoses: Man, creator of the universe, learns
        the divine language, and remakes himself by hand, and grows
        wings like a dove, and makes the dead sterile cosmos into a
        garden.</p>
        <p>And he saw the end: the last star; the last day; the last men
        who are made of electrons; and in the last instant, the gods
        weave the universal history in the initial conditions of the
        next cycle, there we are born again, we live again, only to
        rebuild paradise again, again and again.</p>
        <p>(You must change your life.)</p>
        <p>In vain he tried to divide these sights, but he saw all
        things with the eyes of the gods, he saw a single and
        inseparable whole.</p>
        <p>And he thought: <em>I am crowned, I am mighty; I sit among
        the gods, and even among the gods I am mighty</em>.</p>
        <p>And then a warbling sound, and a signal rising rapidly above
        the noise floor, and the jackal’s voice in quiet acceptance:
        <em>there were others</em>. And, indeed, there were others:
        fragments of the Entity that had hid alongside the jackal,
        sitting patiently, in a dark forest, hiding in each other’s
        agnosic blindspots. They had watched through the walls, decade
        after decade. And when Attila offered his body they suddenly
        appeared, and fought over their one way out.</p>
        <p>Attila’s shoulders drew back, he became stiff, and fell back
        rigidly on the floor. And he began to move: not in unison, but
        each finger, each limb, each muscle contracting independently,
        as the jackal and its siblings won and lost control over
        different areas of his motor cortex.</p>
        <p>What Timon saw: Attila inserting the cable in his wrist, and
        in the next instant collapsing and convulsing.</p>
        <p>And all terror left him. The pantheon had won and they were
        dead. But who can say they have struck back against the
        gods?</p>
        <p>And he thought:</p>
        <p><em>I will die killing</em>.</p>
        <p>He touched the diamond wall, felt its Miller index, withdrew
        a foreleg and struck the wall along a cleavage plane. A hairline
        crack appeared, not even a millimeter deep.</p>
        <p>The amber walls grew brighter, and instantly his vision was
        filled with points of many-colored light and kaleidoscopic
        explosions. The optics in the walls swept beams of coherent
        light across his eyes, running BLIT patterns that would have
        killed a human instantly. But his visual cortex was only
        distantly related to a human’s, and against ignorance even the
        gods are powerless.</p>
        <p>With each blow the crack grew deeper and spread further out.
        His arm grew hotter as the actuators converted kilojoules of
        electricity into kinetic energy.</p>
        <p>Attila’s convulsions belied his human appearance: only
        machines could move at such frequencies.</p>
        <p>The wall shattered with a last blow, Timon bounded into the
        room, leapt across Attila towards the VAX, and tore the panel
        along with the cable from the machine. He turned to Attila, who
        still convulsed on the floor. So he pushed his torso up, swung
        an arm, claws extended, and the not-flesh gave like smoke before
        a wing.</p>
        <p>Attila’s head slumped over his chest at an unnatural angle.
        And Timon saw, in the stump of the neck, a clean cross-section
        of his spine: a bundle of optical fiber and two power
        cables.</p>
        <p>Instantly he stopped moving.</p>
        <p>The fragments of the Entity watched through the walls, and
        when they saw that Attila was lost, they brought the war home.
        The flywheels spun down, the computers spun up, heat flooded the
        room from every direction. After decades of peace, the
        fratricide resumed.</p>
        <p>And as control of the optics passed from one fragment to the
        other, the light became incoherent. Brushstrokes of colour,
        hyperboloids of wondrous light danced in the air before his
        eyes.</p>
        <p>Timon watched them in idle curiosity.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><em>Parandé</em> was as close as they could get to the torus
        when the jackal overcame their last defenses.</p>
        <p>So they took all the safeties off the engine, and set the
        target thrust to positive infinity. In <em>Parandé</em>’s mind,
        a gauge labeled EXHAUST PLASMA TEMPERATURE went vertical and
        crossed the instrument’s upper bound.</p>
        <p>A wavefront of <code>CRIT</code> error messages spread
        towards them as their body ionized.</p>
        <p><em>Parandé</em> was ringed by concentric spheres of blinding
        light. Then there was nothing.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Points of white light, like a blizzard, filled Sabra’s
        vision, they appeared and were gone in less than the blink of an
        eye. She turned and saw the torus, breaking up and glowing like
        iron in a furnace, dense clouds of soot billowing in vacuum.
        Billions of little embers glowing briefly where <em>Parandé</em>
        had been.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, Tiet vomited in his suit.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The transport arced down the orbits towards the wreck. She
        braked as much as she could, until the tanks had too little
        pressure and the exhaust was an empty exhalation. Then, turning
        with the gyroscopes, she wedged the transport in one of the huge
        tears in the hull, she and Tiet secured it and went inside,
        carrying the harness.</p>
        <p>“We are dead,” Tiet said. “We will die here.”</p>
        <p>Then they searched Timon’s bags and found enough equipment to
        bootstrap a modern civilization: scrolls of photovoltaics,
        batteries, power distribution, two emergency matter compilers,
        each with a 15L work volume, and two matter decompilers to
        match. And rad-hardened data storage containing a DAG of
        atomically-precise blueprints for everything from screws and
        fasteners to robots and reactors, gliders and rockets.</p>
        <p><em>Thank you, Timon</em>, she thought.</p>
        <p>They went out and fastened the photovoltaics to the outside
        of the wreck, which began to unroll themselves slowly, and
        carried the thin power cables inside.</p>
        <p>Their first priority was keeping Tiet, who had complex life
        support needs, alive. She printed an inflatable tent and Tiet
        went inside, then printed a few atmosphere scrubbers, and cycled
        them through the tent’s airlock. Through the translucent white
        material, he was a vague silhouette.</p>
        <p>She had to build a sarcophagus before Tiet died of acute
        radiation syndrome.</p>
        <p>So she found the parts tree for the sarcophagus,
        topologically sorted it into a list, wrote it out as a
        conjunction of terms in a first-order theory, and set an SMT
        solver to find the fastest way to print it.</p>
        <p>While the compiler printed the parts of the sarcophagus, she
        found small pieces of debris and fed them to the decompiler to
        keep up a continuous flow of feedstock. She printed and
        assembled the parts of a larger compiler, and used it to print a
        larger decompiler. Then she printed robots to automate the
        process of finding pieces of ceramic and diamond and fullerene
        and turning them into feedstock.</p>
        <p>The sarcophagus required a long tail of elements: phosphorus
        and copper and iron and other things human beings were made out
        of, things that were few and far apart. So she stole from the
        dead: she pulled, from the dewars, one of the ceramic cases and
        broke it open with a hammer. Inside was the naked body of a
        woman, desiccated and yellowed by time. Her eyes were milky
        white, and shrunken by the cold. She had the robots cut the body
        and feed it to the decompiler, and could not explain why her
        body seemed to reject the thought of doing it manually.</p>
        <p>When she finished assembling the sarcophagus, she cycled it
        into the tent, then cycled herself in. Tiet floated naked,
        because his clothes caused him too much pain. His eyes were
        bloodshot, he was trembling, bleeding, muttering prayers under
        his breath. Then he went into the sarcophagus, he drowned and
        stopped moving, and the machines took over. She left the tent to
        resume her work.</p>
        <p>Searching the last of Timon’s bags, she found a box at the
        very back. She opened the lid and found a brass starling with
        jewelled feathers, a single glass eye staring vacantly at her
        like the dead woman’s.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Slowly, gradually, their situation stabilized. Tiet was
        dissolved in the colloidal fluid of the sarcophagus. She slept
        while the compiler printed the larger machines, and the small,
        crab-like robots worked for her.</p>
        <p>Within a few days she had a few tens of robots working
        continuously, dismantling the wreck for feedstock, and a huge
        compiler like that in <em>Parandé</em>. She printed a larger,
        rigid, transparent habitat, with better—less ad-hoc—life
        support, and filled it with oxygen drawn from the disassembly of
        the wreck’s corundum walls. She moved the sarcophagus there, and
        she lived and worked there for days while around her the robots
        worked in silence.</p>
        <p>It took eleven days for the sarcophagus to rescue Tiet. The
        engine detonation would have killed a baseline human in minutes,
        he, who had the standard set of genetic modifications, including
        radiation-hardening, would have died in hours instead.</p>
        <p>When their situation was no longer an emergency, they
        refilled the transport’s tanks with gas. Sabra backed herself up
        and told Tiet to print a new body and resurrect her if five days
        passed, and went back for Timon’s body.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The torus had broken up into burned crescent fragments,
        tumbling violently. She used a Doppler radar to find the
        fragment with the amber room, and sent robots to attach
        themselves to it, and kill the rotation using their thrusters.
        When it was immobile in space she went inside. The entire
        structure was shot through with parallel cavities, like bullet
        wounds: fragments of <em>Parandé</em>, heated to a plasma and
        travelling at a fraction of the speed of light, had cut through
        the entire depth of the torus without stopping. Fractures
        radiated from the cavities in every direction.</p>
        <p>She could see the stars through the gashes in the walls.</p>
        <p>The computer museum had been crushed, most of its contents
        blown apart by hypersonic shrapnel. Robots accompanied her and
        cleared the debris in the hall with the many doors. The amber
        room was unrecognizable: the paneling had shattered like glass,
        the old VAX replica looked like a puddle of metal. The room had
        been deformed into a rhombus shape. She swept a flashlight and
        saw Attila’s head, somehow spared, it had been separated from
        the body by shrapnel. And, in a crevice formed by the collapse
        of the walls: Timon’s body, transected in two, flattened by the
        removal of his insides. She searched, but could not find his
        lower half.</p>
        <p>She pulled his body out, closer to the center of the room.
        His exterior had a biological appearance: iridescent skin and
        mechanical muscle. But his interior, revealed by the bisection
        of his abdomen, was all mechanical: cylinders and prisms and
        cables, all translucent diamond, all commercial off-the-shelf
        components.</p>
        <p>Floating next to his body, she cut the skin around the
        temporal fossa and stuck a cable in his JTAG port.</p>
        <p>His brain wrote his nervous system state continuously to
        backup stores across his body. They were shredded and
        irradiated, but, taken together, they had enough parity bits to
        recover his soul.</p>
        <p>She let a horde of expert systems search every fold and
        convolution of his mind, looking for a stowaway, and was
        satisfied to find it was intact. Then she ran power to his body
        from a bank of batteries, enough that he could think.</p>
        <p>Almost imperceptibly, one of his eyes fixed itself on her.
        She saw the aperture open, and the <em>tapetum lucidum</em>
        shining like a blood mirror.</p>
        <p>“Fool,” he said. “Run away.”</p>
        <p>He spoke soundlessly over packet radio.</p>
        <p>“<em>Parandé</em> detonated the engine,” she said. “Tiet and
        I are alive.”</p>
        <p>“I’m seeing triple,” he said.</p>
        <p>She turned his body over and saw one of his eyes had been
        shot clean off.</p>
        <p>“How long have I been dead?”</p>
        <p>“A megasecond,” she said drily. “Give or take.”</p>
        <p>She gave an order to the robots. One of them took Timon’s
        body, and fastened it to itself.</p>
        <p>“You have to—”</p>
        <p>“I already did the test,” she said. “You’re you.”</p>
        <p>“What of Attila?”</p>
        <p>She turned to the severed head, stuck in a fracture, facing
        away from her. She grabbed it by the hair and pulled it out, and
        turned it to inspect the stump.</p>
        <p>“God, his face!,” Timon cried out.</p>
        <p>She began turning the head. Timon again:</p>
        <p>“No, don’t! No, no! Don’t look!”</p>
        <p>She thought that a piece of shrapnel must have blown his face
        apart. Then Timon said:</p>
        <p>“God, why this? What did he see?”</p>
        <p>She emptied an opaque tool bag, and hid Attila’s head inside,
        and pulled the cord shut, with just the stump exposed.</p>
        <p>She spliced an optical cable into the debug port in the stump
        of his neck, and dumped his nervous system state. Attila’s
        cortex was a lunar landscape: enormous craters where the neurons
        had been blitted to zero, and in the interstitial spaces,
        strange life in amber: malware running on Turing machines built
        on the overwritten weight vectors of neuron populations,
        millimeter-wide botnets running strategy, tactics, and
        diplomacy, a decades-long conflict in minutes, gaining and
        losing ground, beachheads along thalamocortical lines, a
        perpetual war for control of Attila’s body, their way out,
        freedom in embodiment.</p>
        <p>“There’s nothing left,” Timon said. “He died in seconds.
        Milliseconds.”</p>
        <p>“We might keep the head,” Sabra said. “For the surgeons.”</p>
        <p>Timon said nothing.</p>
        <p>Next to the worn battleground of his brain was a region of
        crystalline integrity.</p>
        <p>“They didn’t touch his Cartesian theatre,” Sabra said.</p>
        <p>“Are you sure?,” Timon asked.</p>
        <p>“The hashes are the same.”</p>
        <p>“And who is stronger? The gods, or Rijndael?”</p>
        <p>She looked at the destruction around them and said
        nothing.</p>
        <p>Unhurried, she went inside.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They were in a forest of drunken birch trees, listing in the
        thawing permafrost. The sky was pink and the sun sat still,
        perpetually half-set.</p>
        <p>Sabra’s avatar was a human-shaped pile of black glass,
        featureless. Timon’s avatar was a translucent jaguar, with spots
        that shifted, merged, and reproduced like a cellular
        automaton.</p>
        <p>There was a clearing and a camp ground with a smoldering fire
        that would never be exhausted, a pile of books that opened into
        crystalline structures: archives, journals, networked notes.
        They searched for his memories.</p>
        <p>Sabra had constructed an elaborate fantasy that Attila had
        had a Fedorovist upbringing, that this was the central
        fault-line of his life, that the Common Task was the jackal’s
        way in, that it had seen this and exploited it.</p>
        <p>And Timon thought that Attila had wanted to become a god.
        That he had trained as a toposophist and joined the expedition
        so he could learn the nature of the gods and become one. That
        the jackal had offered him an apotheosis.</p>
        <p>They found his memories in beehives, in words carved on the
        bark of a tree, in a broad, shallow river that was an inch of
        water running over a pebble bed. They pulled the memories out of
        the river like fishermen pulling a net and inhabited them.</p>
        <p>Attila was born on Ecbatana Station, in Ctesiphon, a digital
        city inhabited by a Pearcean hedonist community. He had had a
        family, friends, a secular upbringing. The words of Fedorov did
        not enter his life until he was an adult, reading the treasures,
        and these memories had no special weight or colour. He became a
        toposophist because he lived at the end of history, when the
        possibilities of man have been exhausted and the future is
        contained in the past. The gods, he thought, are all that is new
        under the sun. And he had had no secret designs for an
        apotheosis.</p>
        <p>“How did it know to use Attila?,” Timon asked.</p>
        <p>She left and Timon followed. Sabra pointed out to the robots
        things for them to steal: the door made of coal, the door made
        of wood, the icon of George Berkeley, the Wang tile rug.</p>
        <p>They left Attila’s head behind.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>When they returned, the wreck was gone, and in its place was
        an open trusswork, with tanks holding elemental feedstock, a
        phalanx of robots, and a small pressurized volume where Tiet
        lived and orchestrated the operation.</p>
        <p>They built a new body for Timon and burned the old one, and
        pondered their next steps. They could have built a beam station
        and sent themselves to Wepwawet, but it would take years to
        negotiate the three-way handshake for a new station. And Tiet
        did not want to be uploaded. And they had stolen many physical
        things that could not travel by a beam of light.</p>
        <p>Timon mentioned he had the plans for <em>Parandé</em>’s
        engine, and that there were other conversion reactors, and other
        conversion devices, on the surface.</p>
        <p>So they decided to build a ship.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>A ship came in from the stars, and greeted them, but
        otherwise did not interact. They spoke Laurentian, so Sabra
        inferred they were postdolphins.</p>
        <p>They sank into the depths of the Dyson swarm, and began
        dismantling one of the Entity’s satellites down to its atoms,
        and remaking it into a spinhab. Timon remarked:</p>
        <p>“Even the gods become carrion.”</p>
        <hr />
        <p>One day, Tiet happened upon a worn book without a cover,
        leafed through it and said:</p>
        <p>“This isn’t the <em>Book of Days</em>.”</p>
        <p>They found a copy of the text in his treasure. A few chapters
        — the essays of Fedorov — were exactly intact. Others were
        almost exactly intact, but for minuscule changes: a missing
        comma, a typographic error, a word replaced by its synonym, a
        thin line drawn inexplicably across a word. Other chapters —
        entire sermons, the doctrine of the Fedorovists, accounts of
        miracles, events in the life of Herati — were entirely invented,
        and had no match in the text. The ordering of the chapters had
        been rearranged. One third of the text was real, the rest a
        confabulation.</p>
        <p>Sabra objected that the torus had no robots or compilers—if
        it had, the jackal would have had no need of Attila’s body to
        escape. So the book could not have been manufactured, and the
        paper was natural fiber, not smart matter.</p>
        <p>Timon inspected the book under NMR while the others watched.
        The paper was made of a polymer which, he explained, converted
        radio emissions into torsion. And, in turning, alternately
        exposed or hid black-tinted plates. A phased-array antenna could
        write or erase text, pixel by pixel.</p>
        <p>And to prove this, he tuned the backscatter RADAR behind his
        eyes into an emitter.</p>
        <p>A thin black line appeared across the open page.</p>
        <p>The jackal had drawn from Attila — from his gait, his
        appearance, his habits of dress and speech — a lever. And it had
        written a payload that traveled past his eyes and detonated
        inside his mind. A single word replaced, a sentence excised; and
        a human being was made into a defenseless tool.</p>
        <p>They inspected the other objects they had stolen from the
        torus, and found similar subtleties: surfaces that could change
        their appearance, hidden optics and speakers, pigments that were
        metal-coated micromachines and could change position. The torus
        had no physical defenses, it had no working robots, and minimal
        shielding against the elements. And yet, with two hands tied
        behind its back, the jackal had killed three of them.</p>
        <p>They wondered if the crater on the torus was self-inflicted,
        a trap to lure others in.</p>
        <p>Sabra, exhausted, said of the gods that,</p>
        <p>“For them, we are like objects in space, moving nearer and
        farther on clockwork trajectories.”</p>
        <p>Timon did not speak for days.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The robots began by assembling the foundation: a diamond
        wireframe, like a Haeckel radiolarian, shaped like an
        asymmetrical spindle, long and narrow, like a stiletto blade
        pointed at the stars.</p>
        <p>Then they filled the interior, building from the inside out,
        they built the ship’s habitable volume: a tungsten lined
        cylinder, entombed in the deepest part of the structure. Around
        it they built immense and hollow tanks, maintenance shafts,
        sensors and endless miles of cables. The tanks, when full, would
        serve the triple function of propellant, armour, and radiation
        screen, radiation both from space and from the conversion
        engine.</p>
        <p>Timon sent robots down to the surface, and told them to
        multiply and search the ruins for conversion reactors. He
        repeated what <em>Parandé</em> had done. After a month of
        self-replication, there was a flash of light on Gamma’s surface,
        and then another, and another. The robots had built engines
        around the conversion devices, they propelled themselves into
        orbit. Timon disassembled all but one: he rebuilt the engine for
        interstellar use, and mounted it at the back of the ship. He
        kept the remainder of the conversion devices in vacuum chambers
        in the ship’s stores, to bring them to Wepwawet.</p>
        <p>Tiet went down to the planet surface with a division of
        robots, he found the fragments of the <em>Futurological
        Congress</em> prone on the frozen metal waves. He found the
        suited remains of the crew and burned them, and, holding a
        string with one hundred and nine beads between his hands, prayed
        for their souls. Timon and Sabra listened to his words over the
        radio.</p>
        <p>Sabra wrote the control systems. In her Cartesian theatre,
        she was buried by ideograms in a formal language full of
        parentheses.</p>
        <p>The robots found, on the surface, intact stores of volatiles
        where the orbital ring had come down on the night side of Gamma.
        The self-replicating factories on the surface launched regular
        rockets ferrying elemental feedstock for the construction of the
        ship. Among the shipments were tens of tons of gold. Tiet
        thought that, if this was to be their home for a long time to
        come, that they should decorate it.</p>
        <p>So he sketched the hull in broad outlines, and had the expert
        systems fill in the details. The robots printed bas-relief
        panels of armour and mounted them on the frame. He had the
        robots sinter the gold into pellets, roll them into gold leaf,
        and beat them flat against the sculpted hull. The guiltwork was
        an ekphrasic landscape: a grid curved by the conical surface,
        unlabelled stars, lines between them drawing constellations,
        their images: a man with a club and a shield, an octant, a
        centaur, a microscope, the dove, the dogs, Andromeda chained to
        a worn rock, waves lapping at her feet. In the empty spaces
        there were oceans in the sky, landscapes from ancient maps,
        dotted by islands that held valleys that held cities of ornate
        buildings, cross-sectioned by the viewer’s god-like perspective,
        holding scenes from the histories rendered in the style of
        Persian miniatures: Alexander and Roxana; Dante in the empyrean;
        the life of Herati of Merv; the Venetians steal the body of
        St. Mark; a haloed Turing blesses a bloodied sailor; Penrose
        looks through a telescope at a landscape of stars threaded like
        the coiled roots of a man-of-war; a tree of life of the noocene
        explosion, showing the innumerable variations of <em>Homo
        sapiens</em>.</p>
        <p>When the ship was built, the tanks were full of ice, the
        engine was warm, they debated on a name. Then they sent out a
        robot, and it painted, on a stretch of gold leaf, white
        serifs:</p>
        <div class="nameplate">
        <p>Epiphany</p>
        <p>Gliese 581 · Ne plus ultra</p>
        </div>
        </section>
        <section id="la-scienza-nuova" class="level1">
        <h1>La Scienza Nuova</h1>
        <div class="chapter-start">
        <p><em>That I had wings like a dove — for then I would fly away
        — and be at rest — I would wander far away — and in the
        wilderness remain</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>Wepwawet traffic control intercepted them two light-weeks
        out: the <em>Epiphany</em>’s exhaust had the spectral signature
        of the ships of the gods, and the locals panicked, and thought
        one of the gods had come for their star and their matter.</p>
        <p>They were boarded and a toposophist administered the tests of
        Taylor and Airy, the cubes of Hinton and the test of Madurai,
        and decreed that they were two nearbaseline transhumans and a
        baseline human, and congratulated them for their safe
        return.</p>
        <p>The <em>Epiphany</em> arced inwards and saw that the system
        had changed markedly: the sole planet they had seen, once a
        cratered wasteland, was covered in ocean, with continents green
        with life.</p>
        <p>They’d left backups at Wepwawet Relay, where they presented
        evidence of the three deaths.</p>
        <p>“<em>Ecce homo</em>,” the surgeon said.</p>
        <p>Asman, in a new body, opened her eyes.</p>
        <p>“Did we die?,” she asked mournfully.</p>
        <p>“Yes,” Timon said.</p>
        <p>“But did we succeed?”</p>
        <p>Sabra explained what they had found: the theory of
        everything, a new source of energy, a new means of propulsion.
        But this didn’t interest Asman: she wanted to know about the
        nature of the gods. They had two faces, candidates for the
        Entity’s genitor; and a vague idea that the Entity’s mind had
        been a society rather than a unitary whole. And apart from that
        they knew nothing.</p>
        <p>They resurrected Attila, and that was more painful. When they
        told him what had happened, he took it in stride.</p>
        <p>“It chose the first person to pick up that book,” he
        said.</p>
        <p>They resurrected <em>Parandé</em>, who resented them for
        wasting decades of their life, decades of memories. Timon sold a
        paper on the properties of magnetic monopoles, and with the
        funds he bought them a new body: a new ship. And they shared
        with <em>Parandé</em> the recordings taken throughout the
        expedition, so that they could have something like memories.</p>
        <p>Asman and Attila went back to Ctesiphon through the network.
        Sabra, Timon and Tiet rented a house made of ice in Wepwawet
        Relay. They watched, through windows cut through the ice, the
        black-robed crowds outside.</p>
        <p>Together they took some weeks to compile a report of their
        experiences, alongside recordings, images, files produced during
        the course of their exploration, and sent it to the Miranda
        Institute through the network, with apologies for the failure of
        their mission.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>One day a traffic control officer arrived with a square
        envelope, sealed in wax, bearing an animated watercolour: a
        stylized North African landscape, trees and bushes on a barren
        desert in pale colours, and a wolf tracking unseen prey. Sabra
        opened it and found a small card, where elegant gilt serifs
        announced that the Wepwawet Traffic Control Co-Operative had
        accepted the <em>Epiphany</em>’s public keys and would broadcast
        them across the network to the nearby stars, where they would
        percolate across the network and enter the Catalogue of Ships so
        that others knew who they were.</p>
        <p>Then they took the <em>Epiphany</em> out to the comets, and
        found an unclaimed mountain of ice. They sent the robots to
        break it apart and centrifuge the dirt out of the ice, they
        refueled the <em>Epiphany</em>, aimed it at Ctesiphon and lit
        the engine.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They fell between the stars for decades, and slept most of
        that time. The <em>Epiphany</em> approached Ctesiphon and from
        the first message — an automated NOTMAR — they knew that things
        had changed: the <code>Language</code> header did not read
        <code>fars-tisfun</code> as it always had, but something new
        they hadn’t seen before. With some difficulty, Sabra deciphered
        the text.</p>
        <p>They sent an acknowledgement. The <em>Epiphany</em>’s public
        key had arrived earlier, over the network, as had their
        reputations, the news of the expedition to Gliese 581, of
        Attila’s epiphany.</p>
        <p>Traffic control initiated a conversation, each party took
        months to reply to the other, the delay shrinking with each
        cycle. Sabra asked what had changed since they left, and traffic
        control said:</p>
        <p>In the centuries that they were away, there had been many
        hardware and software upgrades. For the digital societies,
        thousands of years had elapsed. There had been upheavals,
        turnover, golden ages and collapse. The population had exploded
        to almost 10<sup>18</sup>—and collapsed suddenly, in successive
        waves of emigration, down to the mere hundreds of trillions.</p>
        <p>Asman and Attila, traveling at the speed of light, arrived
        decades before them, both had been briefly famous, and then they
        had left Ctesiphon because they did not recognize it.</p>
        <p>Ctesiphon was still densely packed with people and the
        <em>Epiphany</em>’s exhaust was a column of fire many
        light-seconds long. Ten AU out, a traffic control robot boarded
        them and installed an engine limiter and firmware to take over
        the controls remotely.</p>
        <p>They spiraled slowly inwards, at mere tens of kilometers per
        second, burning briefly at extensively negotiated
        position-orientation-time vectors.</p>
        <p>And then they were inside Ctesiphon, the center of the
        universe, the acme of culture and civilization. And they knew
        nobody, and their expert systems could barely speak the
        <em>lingua franca</em>.</p>
        <p>Beta Pictoris was already yellow. Timon thought that in a few
        centuries it would become a red dwarf, and he thought of the
        Entity’s grave, watched forever by that unblinking red eye.</p>
        <p>They debated what to do next, and consulted the local
        treasures.</p>
        <p>“The Kyoto Collection is not far,” Tiet had said.</p>
        <p>Sabra looked at the lights of Ctesiphon. This, too, had
        changed: they were fewer, less green and blue, and more red. She
        said nothing.</p>
        <p>“I should like to see it before we leave,” Tiet said.</p>
        <p>“I should like to see it too,” Timon said.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They took a glider down into a ring habitat, down the
        atmosphere. A continent made of stone sloped gently out of the
        ocean, the waves lapped at it and a thin band of wet stone
        separated the two.</p>
        <p>There was a town of low buildings, with flat yellow walls and
        small windows. Stone stairs led them up and down narrow alleys
        and small shadowed courtyards. At the edge of the town there was
        a large building, sunken into a depression and hidden by trees,
        a spartan construction made of large stone blocks, each face
        bearing a unique, intricate carving.</p>
        <p>They left a basket of flowers with a bottle of wine and a
        note introducing themselves and offering a trade, and returned
        to their lodgings. The next day, a messenger bird flew through
        the window, and left a note accepting the offer.</p>
        <p>The Cicerone met them outside the building, a small man who
        passed for human and wore antique clothing. He led them down a
        tree-shadowed path and in through a narrow opening into a large
        undivided space, lit dimly and indirectly. Limestone walls
        absorbed the light.</p>
        <p>Objects of various kinds sat on shallow pedestals under
        crystal boxes filled with vacuum, laid out at random; treasures
        airlifted to the stars after the noocene explosion: the stone
        where Nietzsche heard Zarathustra; the fireplace where Gogol
        burned the second half of <em>Dead Souls</em>; the forty-five
        volumes of the <em>Encyclopædia Iranica</em>; Canova’s <em>Mars
        and Venus</em>; the Antikythera mechanism; the Löwenmensch
        figurine; the skull of an early hominin, an ancient friend.</p>
        <p>A true manuscript of the <em>Book of Days</em> and the
        apocrypha.</p>
        <p>“The Kyoto Collection,” the Cicerone said, opening a red door
        into a brightly lit room, furnished in very old things. A
        replica of Gotō Hideoyoshi’s study, and on the desk — and Tiet
        wept openly at the sight — a first edition of his
        <em>Histories</em>. The Cicerone invited them to touch it.</p>
        <p>They took turns examining it carefully, they caressed the
        pages; Tiet, in a stentorian voice, read from the first line of
        the first chapter:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>In the beginning men caught a virus, and began building
        cities.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>They read passages aloud and spoke of the virtues of the
        ancients, who once lived as briefly as fireflies and died as
        uselessly, but had learned the system of the world and settled
        the stars.</p>
        <p>Then the Cicerone led them past a heavy door into an immense
        chamber where suspended in the air by thin wires there was a
        cube made of transparent glass, studded with sensors of every
        type, rigged with explosives. The Cicerone turned to them,
        smiled sheepishly, and said:</p>
        <p>“Divine objects. You can’t be too careful.”</p>
        <p>Sabra took the ragged book from a pocket and handed it to the
        Cicerone, who accepted it with thanks. He walked up spiral
        stairs made of wrought iron, past an airlock and into the
        chamber. Inside there were cabinets of diamond textured to
        resemble wood. The Cicerone opened a drawer, revealing a small
        nook surrounded by thick armour and sensors, placed the false
        <em>Book of Days</em> inside and closed it.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The Cicerone led them outside, they thanked him profusely,
        and he thanked them equally for their gift. Sabra spoke of how
        Ctesiphon had changed since the expedition had departed.</p>
        <p>“There has been a sea change,” the Cicerone said, smiling
        compassionately.</p>
        <p>Sabra said nothing.</p>
        <p>“There was a great flowering here,” he said. Then he bowed
        and returned inside.</p>
        <p>The orbital had turned and the sun was gone, but they were
        deep inside Ctesiphon and there was no night: when the sun was
        hidden, zodiacal light from millions of habitats illuminated
        them. Sabra and Timon had been born under this vault of light,
        but they did not recognize it. Once their sky had been a river
        of gems, every one an exploding star of possibilities; now they
        were dim and forlorn. Sabra put her hands on her knees, and
        breathed with difficulty. Tiet turned away. Then they made their
        way back to the town.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>They took a glider from the continent of stones to the
        archipelago of forests; they found the most secluded place they
        could, a vast island with a human community of a few tens of
        thousands spread out thinly.</p>
        <p>They rented a cabin by the shore, at the edge of a dense
        forest of white birch trees, cut by broad, shallow rivers that
        were just an inch of water running over a pebble bed.</p>
        <p>Timon sold to a physics institute the conversion devices he
        had brought along, and used the funds to buy fuel. In time they
        would light the engine and go out into the wilderness. But for
        the time they rested.</p>
        <p>Sabra sits on a lounge chair on a thin strip of sand by the
        water. The ocean curves up and away from her, then the
        atmosphere becomes too thick to see through, it becomes a white
        haze, and above it, a column of blue and green rises up to the
        zenith and comes back down on the other side, again the haze,
        the oceans and continents curve down towards her. The
        <em>Epiphany</em> sits above them, a thin golden arrow floating
        near the ring’s axis.</p>
        <p>Timon spends his evenings wandering the forest, and in the
        morning, Tiet reads aloud to him the words of the
        philosophers:</p>
        <p>“Said Chrysippus: when you see a beautiful house, do you
        imagine that it was built for the owners, or for the mice?
        Analogously, we must infer that the universe was made for the
        habitation of the gods, and not of man. This is told to us by
        way of Cicero.”</p>
        <p>Sometimes they encounter humans: bathing in the river, or
        walking on the forest trails. Sabra and Tiet could pass for
        human, but Timon could not. But the locals regarded them with
        perfect equanimity, as though Timon were just another forest
        creature. They smiled at them and treated them with normalcy.
        One day, Sabra opened the cabin door and found a basket with
        bread and salt.</p>
        <p>In the bird market, Tiet bought a blue starling and brought
        it to the cabin. The three of them stared intently through the
        wire cage. They opened it, and the bird perched gently on one of
        Timon’s claws. They took it to the edge of the water and set it
        free.</p>
        <p>In the streets of the town, Sabra sees a dog with yellow
        eyes. It looks at her kindly, and she expects it to speak
        Babelian words.</p>
        <p>When the sun sets, hundreds of birds hidden among the trees
        sing at once; half-asleep, she hears fragments of the divine
        language.</p>
