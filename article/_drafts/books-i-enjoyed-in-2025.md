    "_Dolce Far Niente_", John Singer Sargent, c. 1905–1909.
---

[_The Apocalypse of Herschel Schoen_][apoc] by [nostalgebraist][nost]. A revelation (ἀποκάλυψις = "unveiling") told through the eyes of a developmentally-disabled teenager. You will never guess where it goes. This came across my desk because I really enjoyed [_The Northern Caves_][north], which is both a great horror story and an evocation of the Internet forum culture of the late 2000's.

[_Algebraic Models for Accounting Systems_][amas]. I like anything along the lines of, "let's take a technical field that formed its ontology, vocabulary, methods etc. before modern mathematics, and set it on a modern, algebraic, formal foundation". And this is that, for accounting. It is a pleasant read.

[_Confessions of a Mask_][mask] by [Yukio Mishima][mishima]. The artist's confession. "I had decided I could love a girl without feeling any desire whatsoever".

[_Paul and Virginia_][petv] by [Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre][jh]. Published in 1788, very sentimental, but I think it helped me to get in the mindset of late 17th century French society: the bucolic, Rousseauist kick, the whole "simplicity of nature" thing. This landed on my reading list because many, many years ago I read a [Cordwainer Smith][cs] story called [_Alpha Ralpha Boulevard_][arb], and I read somewhere that the characters in the story, Paul and Virginia, were an allusion to _Paul et Virginie_.

[_De Monarchia_][mon] by [Dante][dante]. This is another "get into the mindset of another century" book. It's interesting because it's written like a logical, geometric proof: there's _modus ponens_ and _modus tollens_ and case analysis and proof by contradiction. But the axioms are very eclectic: quotations from various Virgil, Plato, Livy, Cicero, Thomas Aquinas et al. and Dante's private interepretation of bits from the Bible. The theorem he wants to prove is that to attain the highest development of humanity, the whole world must be unified into a world-state ran by the Holy Roman Emperor.

[_Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine_][simcity] by [Chaim Gingold][gingold]. Nominally an oral history of the development of SimCity. That's how he gets you. Then the trap is sprung, and you are given a history of cybernetics, WW2 fire control systems, cellular automata, artificial life, computation, Vannevar Bush, pedagogy, cognition, the [World3][w3] model, [_The Limits to Growth_][lim], Forrester's [system dynamics][sd]. "Unexpectedly Borgesian technical book" is one of my favourite genres.

[_Antigone_][anti] by [Sophocles][soph], in the translation of [Robert Fagles][fagles]. "Don’t fear for me. Set your own life in order".

[_The Education of Cyrus_][cyrus] by [Xenophon][xeno]. I'm not sure what to make of it, honestly, but when I have the time I want to read [Leo Strauss][leo]'s [lectures][lec] on Xenophon, where he expounds on the hidden meaning of the text.

[_Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir_][borrowed] by [Paul Monette][paul]. The author's account of caring for his partner who was dying of AIDS in the 80's, while he himself was actively dying from AIDS. Frightful. The author died just a few years before HAART therapy became available.

[_The Slave_][slave] by [Isaac Bashevis Singer][singer]. Singer is unique. I don't know quite how to characterize it. His writing is very disarming and innocent without being sentimental, he is earnest and free of cynicism. A love story in 17th century Poland, after the [Khmelnytsky pogroms][pogrom]. It's very magical realist, in a good way, not in the [hysterical] sense. The world is shot through with the supernatural, but the inner lives of the characters oscillate between religious awe and a very contemporary cynicism.

[_Dream Story_][dream] by [Arthur Schnitzler][as]. The inspiration for [_Eyes Wide Shut_][eyes]. I was surprised by how much of the movie, that I thought was mostly Kubrick's invention, is actually from the story. It's a great mood piece: you can feel the cold of early morning in Vienna, and see the paving stones, and the gas lamps, and the carriages disappearing in the fog.

[_The Cyberiad_][cyberiad] by [Stanisław Lem][lem]. I like Lem when he's serious ([_Solaris_][sol], [_His Master's Voice_][hmv]) and not so much when he's doing satire ([_The Futurological Congress_][fut]) so when I picked this up years ago and saw that it was a collection of fairy tales I put it away. I tried again this year and found I actually enjoyed it, but some of the later stories go on for far too long. I think _The Seventh Sally_ is the one everyone likes.

[_The Magician of Lublin_][lublin] by [Isaac Bashevis Singer][singer]. Another Singer, this time in 19th century Poland. A rake is punished by God. Short and fun. I like that Singer doesn't write giant doorstoppers, so that quality per page is high.

[_Mephisto_][mephisto] by [Klaus Mann][mann]. A socialist actor in interwar Germany saves his career by making friends with the Nazis. I was surprised by how Randian it was: the characters are divided into two disjoint categories, the Good, who are upper middle class, burgeois people, or aristocrats from old and noble families, and the Bad, who are vulgar, parvenus, thugs, and boors. It's kind of ironic to think people become Nazis because of bad breeding.

[_What Is Life?_][life] by [Erwin Schrödinger][es]. Before modern crystallography, NMR, DFT etc. people had to learn about the nanoscale through clever reasoning. Schrödinger uses the limited knowledge of the day to set up a constraint system, and finds the solution: genetic information is stored in an aperiodic, covalently-bonded crystal, and he even estimates the physical volume of the genome from experiments relating mutation rates to X-ray exposure.

[_Satan in Goray_][goray] by [Isaac Bashevis Singer][singer]. Another Singer, back in the 17th century, this one is more fire and brimstone, and it's about a historical episode I had not heard about until the last few pages of _The Slave_: the case of [Sabbatai Zevi][zevi], a Jewish mystic who, at one point, had most of the Jewish world convinced he was the messiah. This happened in the year 1666. The novel is about what it's like, phenomenologically, to live in a remote village in 1600's Poland. How do you know anything about the world? People come in, from time to time, traders, and they have news, but the news are just words that come out of their mouth. And you have to interrogate them, ask questions, compare notes. Like living in a Pacific island. Has the messiah come? Is there such a place as the Ottoman Empire? Is there even a world outside Poland?

[_Tog on Interface_][toi] by [Bruce Tognazzini][tog]. A book about interface design from 1992. A lot of the advice is good, and a lot of it is interesting for the historical context, and the constraints people worked with in the past. One aspect I found interesting: how many products and companies are mentioned of whose existence I can find little to no evidence today. This makes the hoarder in me sad. This one across my desk because I read a [blog post][blog] implementing one of the UI ideas from the book.

[_Term Rewriting and All That_][traat] by [Franz Baader][baader] and [Tobias Nipkow][nipkow]. I feel that I understand what computation is now.

[_Indistinguishable From Magic_][magic] by [Robert L. Forward][forward]. If you've spent years steeped in [_Orion's Arm_][oa] then most of the ideas in the book will not be new to you. But they were new once. And it's interesting to read a book and think: this is where [starwisps][sw] and [launch loops][loop] all come from.

[_The Shadow of the Torturer_][shadow] by [Gene Wolfe][wolfe]. Surreal and a pleasure to read.

[_Knowledge Representation: Logical, Philosophical, and Computational Foundations_][kr] by [John F. Sowa][sowa]. Delightful, particularly the early bits about the history of logic, and many chapters explaining the work of [Peirce][peirce] and [Whitehead][whitehead] on ontology.

I have not finished reading this book, but I am in the first few pages of [_A Shorter Model Theory_][asmt] by [Wilfrid Hodges][hodges], and I am delighted. The very first exercise in the book involves a formalization of Aquinas' account of the trinity.
