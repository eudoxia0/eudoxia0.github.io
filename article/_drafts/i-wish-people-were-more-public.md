title: I Wish People Were More Public
---

Probably not a popular thing to say today. The zeitgeisty thing to say
is that we should all log off and live shitty cottagecore lives
raising chickens and being mindful. I wish people were more online and
more public. I have rarely wished the opposite. Consider this post
addressed to you, the reader.

# Your Writing

I will often find a blog post on [Hacker News][hn] that really
resonates. And when I go to check the rest of the site there's three
other posts. And I think: I wish you'd write more! When I find someone
whose writing resonates, I like to read everything they have written,
or at least a tractable subset of their most interesting posts. If you
like what you see, you can reach out. This is one of the best things
about writing online: your future friends will seek you out.

And, from the other side, I have often written a post where, just
before publishing, I would think: "who would want to read this? It's
too personal, obscure, idiosyncratic, probably a few people will
unsubscribe to the RSS feed for this". And always those are the posts
where people email me to say that they always thought the same thing
but could never quite put it into words. I really value those
emails. "I am understood" is a wonderful feeling.

I try to apply a rule that if I do something, and I don't write about
it---or otherwise generate external-facing evidence that I did it---it
didn't happen. I have built so many things in the dark, little
experiments or software projects that never saw the light of day. I
want to put more things out. If it doesn't merit and entire blog post,
then at least a tweet.

# Your Books

If I follow you on Twitter, and you have posted a picture of your
bookshelf, I have probably scanned every book in it. This is why I
appreciate [Goodreads][gr]. Like many people I have been reading a lot
less over the past ~5y, but since I made a Goodreads account earlier
this year, I've read tens of books. I think what has helped is that
now I'm reading in public.

You may say reading in public is performative. I say reading in
private is solipsistic. Consider the words of Dante, in [_De
Monarchia_][mon]:

> All men on whom the Higher Nature has stamped the love of truth
> should especially concern themselves in laboring for posterity, in
> order that future generations may be enriched by their efforts, as
> they themselves were made rich by the efforts of generations

> not to contribute something to the public good, is far in arrears of
> his duty, let him be assured; he is, indeed, not "a tree planted by
> the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season,"
> [Psalms 1:3] but rather a destructive whirlpool, always engulfing,
> and never giving back what it has devoured.

My default mode is solipsism. I read in private, build in private,
learn in private. And the problem with that is self-doubt. I'm halfway
through a textbook and think: why? Why am I learning geology? Why
_this_ topic, and not another? There is never an _a priori_ reason. I
take notes, but why tweak the LaTeX if no-one, probably not even
future me, will read them?

And Goodreads, for all its annoyances, is a uniquely tender social
network. Finishing a book, and then seeing a friend mark it as "want
to read" feels like a moment of closeness.

I have a friend that lived in Sydney, and now lives in America, and we
don't keep in touch too often, because the timezones are inconvenient,
but occasionally she likes my book updates, and I like hers, and I
will probably never read that avant-garde novel, but I'm glad you are
reading it. It is like sayin: "You exist. I exist. I remember. I wish
you happiness."

# Your Flashcards

- intro:
  - lots of people use flashcards
  - their decks are private by default
  - some people will export a deck, and share it eg on ankiweb
    - e.g. gwern's deck
  - but this is a frozen snapshot of time
- hashcards:
  - one reason i built hashcards is that, by treating the flashcard
    collection as a tree of Markdown files, it allows people to put it
    on Git, and, as a next step, put it on GitHub
  - my own flashcards collection is public
  - i wish more people's collections were public
    - not to copy what they have
      - this is useless
      - you need to write youir own
    - but because i'm curious what they find interesing
      - not really the broad strokes (we all want to learn thermo and
        econ and quantum chemistry and so on and on and on) but the
        minutiae. why did you make a flashcard of this Bible passage?
        why does it resonate with you?

# Your Dotfiles

- intro
  - computers mediate every aspect of our lives
  - yet, most people use their computers, basically, the way they came
    out of the box
  - maybe they change the desktop background, but that's it
  - there's something really interesting about people who take agency
    in their experience of computing
  - who step off the straight and narrow path, and make a really
    personal, idiosyncratic experience of computing.
  - so, I am curious: how do you use your computer?
    - what editor do you use? why?
    - what shell? why?
    - do you have some esoteric browser extension you like?
    - what scripts have you written?
