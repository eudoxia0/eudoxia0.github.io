Probably not a popular thing to say today. The zeitgeisty thing to say is that
we should all log off and live terrible cottagecore solarpunk lives raising
chickens and being mindful. I wish people were more online and more public. I
have rarely wished the opposite. Consider this post addressed to you, the
reader.

# Your Writing

I will often find a blog post on [Hacker News][hn] that really
resonates. And when I go to check the rest of the site there's three
other posts. And I think: I wish you'd write more! When I find someone
whose writing resonates, I like to read everything they have written,
or at least a tractable subset of their most interesting posts. If you
like what you see, you can reach out. This is one of the best things
about writing online: your future friends will seek you out.

And, from the other side, I have often written a post where, just
before publishing, I would think: "who would want to read this? It's
too personal, obscure, idiosyncratic, probably a few people will
unsubscribe to the RSS feed for this". And always those are the posts
where people email me to say that they always thought the same thing
but could never quite put it into words. I really value those
emails. "I am understood" is a wonderful feeling.

I try to apply a rule that if I do something, and I don't write about
it---or otherwise generate external-facing evidence that I did it---it
didn't happen. I have built so many things in the dark, little
experiments or software projects that never saw the light of day. I
want to put more things out. If it doesn't merit and entire blog post,
then at least a tweet.

# Your Books

If I follow you on Twitter, and you have posted a picture of your
bookshelf, I have probably scanned every book in it. This is why I
appreciate [Goodreads][gr]. Like many people I have been reading a lot
less over the past ~5y, but since I made a Goodreads account earlier
this year, I've read tens of books. I think what has helped is that
now I'm reading in public.

You may say reading in public is performative. I say reading in
private is solipsistic. Consider the words of Dante, in [_De
Monarchia_][mon]:

> All men on whom the Higher Nature has stamped the love of truth
> should especially concern themselves in laboring for posterity, in
> order that future generations may be enriched by their efforts, as
> they themselves were made rich by the efforts of generations
> past. For that man who is imbued with public teachings, but cares
> not to contribute something to the public good, is far in arrears of
> his duty, let him be assured; he is, indeed, not "a tree planted by
> the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season,"
> [Psalms 1:3] but rather a destructive whirlpool, always engulfing,
> and never giving back what it has devoured.

My default mode is solipsism. I read in private, build in private,
learn in private. And the problem with that is self-doubt. I'm halfway
through a textbook and think: why? Why am I learning geology? Why
_this_ topic, and not another? There is never an _a priori_ reason. I
take notes, but why tweak the LaTeX if no-one, probably not even
future me, will read them? If I stop reading this book, what changes?
And doing things in public makes them both more real and (potentially)
useful.

And Goodreads, for all its annoyances, is a uniquely tender social
network. Finishing a book, and then seeing a friend mark it as "want
to read" feels like a moment of closeness.

I have a friend that lived in Sydney, and now lives in America, and we
don't keep in touch too often, because the timezones are inconvenient,
but occasionally she likes my book updates, and I like hers, and I
will probably never read that avant-garde novel, but I'm glad you are
reading it. It is like sayin: "You exist. I exist. I remember. I wish
you happiness."

# Your Flashcards

Lots of people use [spaced repetition][sr], but most everyone's
flashcard collections are private. They exist inside a database inside
an app like [Anki][anki] or [Mochi][mochi]. You can export decks, but
that's not a living artifact but a dead snapshot, frozen in time.

One reason I built [hashcards][hc]: by using a Git repo of Markdown
files as the flashcard database, you can trivially publish your deck
to GitHub. [My own flashcard collection][cards] is public. I hope that
more people use hashcards and put their decks up on GitHub.

The point is not that you can clone their repos (which is close to
useless: you have to write your own flashcards) but because I'm
curious what people are learning. Not the broad strokes, since we all
want to learn thermo and econ and quantum chemistry and the military
history of the Song dynasty and so on, but the minutiae. Why did you
make a flashcard out of this Bible passage? Why does it resonate with
you?

# Your Dotfiles

Computers mediate every aspect of our lives, yet most people use their
computers the way they came out of the box. At most they might change
the desktop background. Some people don't even change the default
icons on the macOS dock. Even most Linux users just use the stock
configuration, e.g. GNOME on Fedora or whatever.

I'm interested in people who customize their experience of
computing. This is often derided as "[ricing][rice]". But agency is
interesting. People who remake their environment to suit them are
interesting. And I am endlessly curious about how people do this. I
like reading people's `init.el`, their custom shell scripts, their
NixOS config. It's even better if they have some obscure hardware
e.g. some keyboard layou I've never heard of and a trackball with
custom gestures. I put my [dotfiles][dot] up on GitHub because I
imagine someone will find them interesting.
