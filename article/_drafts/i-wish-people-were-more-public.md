title: I Wish People Were More Public
---

Probably not a popular thing to say today. The zeitgeisty
thing to say is that we should all log off and live shitty
cottagecore lives raising chickens and being mindful. I wish
people were more public. I have rarely wished the
opposite. Consider this post addressed to you, the reader.

# Your Writing

- read
  - sometimes i read blog post and really resonate with the
    author's thinking
  - then i check the blog and there's three other posts
  - and i will think: I wish you'd write more!
  - when you read someone that really resonates, it is
    worthwhile to read everything else that person has written
- from the other side:
  - i have often written a blog post where, just before
    publishing, I think: God, who could possibly want to
    read _this_? It's so obscure or personal or
    idiosyncratic.
  - Those posts are often the ones where people email me to
    thank for writing them, to share that they always
    thought the same thing, and they're glad someone put it
    into words.
  - I really value those emails. "I am understood" is the
    most wonderful feeling.
- write:
  - i have tried to develop this rule
  - if i do it, and don't write about it, it didn't happen
  - i try to apply this bc i write lots of personal software
    and little experiments and often, if i doint write about
    it here (or at least tweet about it), it is as if it
    didn't happen
  - not everything deserves a blog post, little things can
    be a tweet
    - e.g. custom invoice format

# Your Books

- if you have posted a pic of your bookshelf on twitter i
  have scanned all of it
- goodreads
  - this is why i appreciate goodreads
  - since i made a goodreads account, i've been reading a lot
    more
  - you might say that reading in public is performative
  - i counter that reading in private is solipsistic
  - consider dante
- friends
  - besides, goodreads, for all its many annoyances, is a
    uniquely tender social network
  - finishing a book, and then seeing a friend on my feed mark
    it as "want to read", feels like a moment of closeness
  - i have a friend who moved out of Sydney, and we don't
    talk often, because we have inconvenient timezones, but
    she likes all my book progress updates and I like all of
    hers. it's a nice way to stay in touch. I will probably
    never read that avant-garde novel, but I'm glad you're
    reading it. You continue to exist. I exist.

# Your Flashcards

- lots of people use flashcards
- their decks are private by default
- some people will export a deck, and share it eg on ankiweb
- but this is a frozen snapshot of time
- one reason i built hashcards is that, by treating the
  flashcard collection as a tree of Markdown files, it
  allows people to put it on Git, and, as a next step, put
  it on GitHub
- my own flashcards collection is public
- i wish more people's collections were public
- i want to learn what people are interested in. not really
  the broad strokes (we all want to learn thermo and econ
  and quantum chemistry and so on and on and on) but the
  minutiae. why did you make a flashcard of this Bible
  passage? why does it resonate with you?

# Your Dotfiles

- this is rather obscure and probably pertains mostly to
  software engineers
- some people put their computer's configuration up online
- these are called "dotfiles", from the practice that
  configuration files are often have names starting with a
  period, because on Unix (and later macOS), files that
  start with a period are normally hidden from users (in
  Finder, you can see this with [TODO command sequence])
- and so dotfiles are a metonym for "a system's
  configuration"
- why do I find this interesting?
- computers mediate every aspect of our lives
- yet, most people use their computers, basically, the way
  they came out of the box
- maybe they change the desktop background, but that's it
- there's something really interesting about people who take
  agency in their experience of computing, who step off the
  straight and narrow path, and make a really personal,
  idiosyncratic experience of computing.
- so, I am curious: how do you use your computer?
- for programmers:
  - what editor do you use? why?
  - what shell? why?
  - do you have some esoteric browser extension you like?
  - what scripts have you written?
- for normal people:
  - what does your background look like?
  - do you use a screensaver?
