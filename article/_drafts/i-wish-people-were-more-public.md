title: I Wish People Were More Public
---

- intro
  - probably not a popular thing to say
    - nowadays the popular thing to say is we should all be
      offline and live shitty cottagecore lives and raise
      chickens and be mindful
  - i wish people were more public
  - i rarely wish the opposite
  - consider this post addressed to you, the reader
- writing
  - sometimes i read blog post and really resonate with the
    author's thinking
  - then i check the blog and there's three other posts
  - and i will think: I wish you'd write more!
  - when you read someone that really resonates, it is
    worthwhile to read everything else that person has
    written
  - from the other side: i have often written a blog post
    where, just before publishing, I think: God, who could
    possibly want to read _this_? It's so obscure or
    personal or idiosyncratic. Those posts are often the
    ones where people email me to thank for writing them, to
    share that they always thought the same thing, and
    they're glad someone put it into words. I really value
    those emails. "I am understood" is the most wonderful
    feeling.
  - try to develop a rule where if I do it and don't write
    about it, it didn't happen
- flashcards
  - lots of people use flashcards
  - their decks are private by default
  - some people will export a deck, and share it eg on
    ankiweb
  - but this is a frozen snapshot of time
  - one reason i built hashcards is that, by treating the
    flashcard collection as a tree of Markdown files, it
    allows people to put it on Git, and, as a next step, put
    it on GitHub
  - my own flashcards collection is public
  - i wish more people's collections were public
  - i want to learn what people are interested in. not
    really the broad strokes (we all want to learn thermo
    and econ and quantum chemistry and so on and on and on)
    but the minutiae. why did you make a flashcard of this
    Bible passage? why does it resonate with you?
