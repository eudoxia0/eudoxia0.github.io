title: Linux on the Fujitsu Lifebook U729
---

- context
  - past few months
  - had three computers
  - none portable
  - thought about buying a new macbook air
  - but tahoe sucks
	- border radius
  - started playing around with linux and fell in love again
- wanted a linux laptop
  - i was disappointed by the thinkpad x1
  - browsing refurbs
  - randomly came across the fujitsu
  - the price/specs was really good: 250AUD for 16GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD storage, and a 2020 processor
  - and it's 12in, which i like
  - but i think the main thing was the vibe: a Fujitsu laptop!
	- like the thinkpad of thinkpads
	- i'm already a huge hipter: I just NixOS and a trackball and stumpwm
    - so this is the apotheosis of being a tech hipster
- problems
  - secureboot
	- things that didn't work
	- how to disable
  - weird shitty spyware thing
- once disabling secure boot, installing nixos was easy
