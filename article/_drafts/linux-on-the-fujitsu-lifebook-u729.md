title: Linux on the Fujitsu Lifebook U729
---

This post describes my experience using Linux on the [Fujitsu Lifebook
U729][laptop]. The tl;dr is that this is a delightful laptop, and Linux runs
flawlessly, and all the hardware things I've needed run OOTB. The only
difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it,
which I explain below.

  - the price/specs was really good: 250AUD for 16GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD storage, and a 2020 processor
  - and it's 12in, which i like
  - but i think the main thing was the vibe: a Fujitsu laptop!
	- like the thinkpad of thinkpads
	- i'm already a huge hipter: I just NixOS and a trackball and stumpwm
    - so this is the apotheosis of being a tech hipster
