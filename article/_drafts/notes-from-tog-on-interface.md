# Keyboard vs. Mouse

p. 26:

> We've done a cool $50 million of R&D on the Apple Human Interface. We
> discovered, among other things, two pertinent facts:
>
> - Test subjects consistently report that keyboarding is faster than mousing.
> - The stopwatch consistently proves mousing is faster than keyboarding.
>
> This contradiction between user-experience and reality apparently forms the
> basis for many user/developers’ belief that the keyboard is faster.
>
> People new to the mouse find the process of reaching for it every time they
> want to do anything other than type to be incredibly time-wasting. And therein
> lies the very advantage of the mouse: It is boring to find it because the
> two-second search does not require high-level cognitive engagement.
>
> It takes two seconds to decide upon which special-function key to
> press. Deciding among abstract symbols is a high-level cognitive function. Not
> only is this decision not boring, the user actually experiences amnesia!
> _Real_ amnesia! The time-slice spent making the decision simply ceases to
> exist.
>
> While the keyboard users in this case feel as though they have gained two
> seconds over the mouse users, the opposite is really the case. Because while
> the keyboard users have been engaged in a process so fascinating that they
> have experienced amnesia, the mouse users have been so disengaged that they
> have been able to continue thinking about the task they are trying to
> accomplish. They have not had to set their task aside to think about or
> remember abstract symbols.
>
> Hence, users achieve a significant productivity increase with the mouse in
> spite of their subjective experience.

c.f.: colour visual illusions. "this pixel is not actually red". but colour is
perception: subjectivity before wavelengths

Counter on p.32:

> I disagree, however, with the premise that mousing is faster than keyboarding
> (notice that I did not say that I believe keyboarding is faster than
> mousing). I believe that making such assumptions will stand in the way of
> providing the user the ability to determine just how he will interact with the
> computer for any given function at any given time.

> In your article you state "The keyboard users in this case feel as though they
> have gained two seconds over the mouse users, but the opposite is really the
> case." To the keyboard users, it may not matter that they were actually
> slower, because they have perceived a speed increase over using the mouse. It
> is the subjective nature of perception and the disparity between perception
> and reality that gives rise to the “religious” nature of these discussions.
>
> I came across an interesting example of perception vs. reality while designing
> a small text editor: When scrolling the text horizontally in a window we would
> refresh the text by redisplaying each line starting at the top. This resulted
> in a wave of text rippling down the screen and many complaints that the screen
> refresh was too slow. The remedy was to scroll the bits already on screen and
> then redisplay each line from the top. The second implementation was actually
> slower than the first because we incurred the overhead of scrolling the bits
> before we even started to display the new text on the screen. However, the
> perception was that there was an immense increase in speed. We stuck with the
> second implementation because it increased the overall satisfaction of the
> user even though it actually decreased the throughput of the product.
>
> In my mind, perception is stronger than reality. A user’s perception of a
> product is what causes him to purchase it and influences his satisfaction with
> the product....

# Words

p. 31:

> **GUIDELINE:** Words like "kill," "abort," and "default" have powerful
> emotional charges connected with them and have no place in the
> interface. Instead, use words like "stop," "cancel," and "standard."
