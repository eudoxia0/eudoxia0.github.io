title: Failure Modes in Spaced Repetition
summary: And how to overcome them.
---

# Going Too Fast

- Failing to fully mentally represen the card's content before answering.
- Also, if you get most things right, it just becomes a habit to click "remembered", and then recall the information.

# Piling On Too Much

- Having to review hundreds of cards in a day makes it feel daunting and increases dropoff.

# Habit Formation Failure

- Probably the most common failure mode.
- People discover SR, go mad with power, put everything in, use it for 2 weeks and then break off, therefore failing to remember anything long-term.
- Make it a habit _first_, ideally with a small number of relatively unimportant cards.
- If you use a todo list app like Todoist or Reminders, just a daily recurring task to do the reviews. Or you can put a recurring calendar task. 15m is more than enough.
- When you're able to do it regularly, then it's time to load up on cards.

# Being Unhappy:

- If your todo list is just a list of things you hate doing, you will become averse to it.
- Analogously, if your reviews are mostly things you don't care about, or don't properly understand, you will become averse to it.
- And if you hate it, it's very easy to just hit spacebar for the entire review, mark everything "remembered" without recalling anything, and fuck up the review schedule of every card, just to get it over with.
- This is ultimately counterproductive.
- You might want to introspect into why you're doing this.
- But one solution is to try to do it on your own terms.
  - You are allowed to add "useless" but fun things to the deck.
  - Things you care about even if some part of you thinks you shouldn't.
  - My deck has poetry, trivia, archaic English words I will never use.
  - You can read an RPG rulebook and put the rules and the lore in as flashcards. Why not? If it takes some of the weight off, then it's worth doing.

# Undiagnosed ADHD

- Maybe the reason you can't make spaced repetition into a habit is the same reason you can't seem to form any good habits—namely, you have ADHD.
- In this case, it's best to talk to a psychiatrist and get things addressed rather than keep beating your head against the wall.
- Biological problems should be addressed at the level of biology.

# Cards not atomic enough.

- Not really clear what you're recalling.

# Relying too much on Cloze deletion

- Unwittingly just memorizing the visual shape of the cards.

- Remember the hierarchy of effectiveness from Gwern's posts.

# Memorizing before understanding

- does not work

# "Inbox Overhang"

- adding hundreds of new cards, but you can only consolidate a couple of new ones every day.
- So by the time you pare down the inbox enough to get to the later cards, you find—you no longer remember what those were about.
- So you can't actually memorize them.

# Domain Mismatch

- When the problem domain is too procedural/physical and hard to verbalize/formalize.

# Lack of Utility

- Lacking what Andy Matuschak calls a "serious context of use".
- Like people who do extensive note-taking and have a "second brain" but don't really do anything useful.
- If it's not actually useful you know it.
- Are you just doing SR because Gwern does it and it becomes a kind of aspirational practice?
- Andy Matuschak in the Dwarkesh podcast:
  - Talks about how the failure of using SR more widely is not a market failure but a case of market efficiency.
  - Most people probably don't need SR. And if they do, they can get away with a small deck of cute or useful facts.

# Low Multiplicity

- from graph theory, the multiplicity of an edge is the number of edges that share endpoints
- Asking questions in a single direction (e.g. "What is the capital of France?")
- instead of multiple ones (e.g. "What is the capital of France?", "What country is Paris the capital of?", "What is the relationship between Paris and France?").

# Density Mismatch

- too many cards for things you will remember.
- too few cards for concepts you are too vague about.
- This mismatch is problematic for two reasons:
  - You're wasting time on things you have already consolidated.
  - You're getting a vague and faulty understanding of things you know less about. Which hurts when you try to build on top of that shaky foundation.
- One way to think about this is: imagine the concept graph, and imagine overlaying a heatmap of it. The cold regions are things you understand already and need a low card density, the hot regions are concepts you want to approach from multiple directions in order to grasp them more effectively.

# No Mastery Learning:

- Related to density mismatch.
- failing to practice mastery learning! You have to really consolidate something before moving on.

# Using Pre-Built Decks

- also related to density mismatch
- The process of writing the deck is part of the understanding.
- Involving the motor cortex creates more lasting memory traces.
- Also, writing your own decks makes it easier to, like, match the density of the cards to the things you want to know.
- Pre-built decks are probably fine for highly factual, uniform-density domains.
- Like you can use a pre-built deck for the NATO phonetic alphabet.
- Also, the problem of using other people's decks is you can't learn from the decks. You have to understand first, then memorize. And understanding is best done in literally any other format than reading poorly-ordered SR decks, mostly because there's no canonical order to the cards.

# Low Effort Cards

- recall effort correlated with future recall
