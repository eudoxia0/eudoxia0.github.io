title: Some Data Should Be Code
---

I write a lot of Makefiles. I use it not as a command runner but as an ad-hoc build system for small projects, typically for compiling Markdown documents and their dependencies. Like so:

<img style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;" src="/assets/content/some-data-should-be-code/graph.png" alt="TODO"/>

And the above graph was generated by this very simple Makefile:

```makefile
graph.png: graph.dot
	dot -Tpng $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -f graph.png
```

(I could never remember the [automatic variable][av] syntax until I made [flashcards][fc] for them.)

It works for simple projects, when you can mostly hand-write the targets. But the abstraction ceiling is very low. If you have a bunch of almost identical targets, e.g.:

```makefile

```
