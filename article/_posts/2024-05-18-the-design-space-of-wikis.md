  - plain text with links
    - plain text
    - but with specific markup for links
  - formatted text
    - simple formatting: bold, lists, etc.
  - rich text with metadata
    - example: notion
    - typed properties aside from the text
    - "main text" remains a privileged own thing
  - typed properties
    - "main text" no longer a privileged thing
    - an object is a map of property names to values
    - some values may be rich text
  - mixin: fixed-length content
    - to simulate the limitations of paper
    - content may be limited to some fixed length
    - examples: none that i know of
- identifiers
  - unreadable identifiers
    - uuids
    - make it possible to rename things in a consequence free fashion
    - usually have to be hidden, requires WYSIWYG editing and a database
    - examples: notion

      - obsidian
