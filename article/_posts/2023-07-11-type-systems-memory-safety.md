title: "Type Systems for Memory Safety"
summary: A survey of type systems for memory safety.
---

Manual memory management and memory safety used to be incompatible. But it is
possible to design programming languages and type systems that provide memory
safety at compile time, combining the safety of high-level languages with the
performance and low-level control of languages like C.
