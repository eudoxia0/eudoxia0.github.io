title: The Nova of 134 BCE
summary: .
---

A nova appeared in the sky in 134 BCE. This is attested by the court astronomers of [Han China][han]. It is possibly the same nova that, according to [Pliny], inspired [Hipparchus] to compile the first catalogue of stars.

# The Second Sun of Cicero

[Cicero], in [_De Natura Deorum_][denat], writes of the omens that cause men to believe in gods:

[Cicero]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero
[denat]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum

>[...] and the doubling of the sun, which my father told me had happened in the consulship of [Tuditanus][tud] and [Aquilius][aq], the year in which the light was quenched of [Publius Africanus][aem], that second sun of Rome [...] [^cic]

[aq]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manius_Aquillius_(129_BC)
[aem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipio_Aemilianus

"Publius Africanus" here is not [the elder][afri], but his adptive grandson, hereafter Scipio Aemilianus. He died in 129 BCE, the year of the consulship of Tuditanus and Aquilius. Cicero repeats the story in [_De Re Publica_][dere].

I found this intriguing. What was this phenomenon? Was it just a [sun dog][sundog], or could it have been a supernova? Searching for records of ancient supernovae, I found an interesting connection: Pliny wrote that Hipparchus, the Greek astronomer, was inspired to compile his catalogue of stars by the appearance of a "new star" in the sky. Hipparchus made his observations in Rhodes c. 129 BCE, the same year as the new sun of Cicero. So we have two observations of new stars, from around the same time.

# The Treatise on the Celestial Offices

In the [_Records of the Grand Historian_][shiji] (completed ~91 BCE) there is also a treatise on astronomy, which says:

[shiji]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiji

> 元光、元狩，蚩尤之旗再見，長則半天。
>
> During the Yuanguang and Yuanshou periods, [Chiyou]'s banner appeared again, stretching halfway across the sky.

[Chiyou]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiyou

Yuanshou (元狩) is the period from 122 BCE to 117 BCE. This appears to be describing a comet. Also in the _Records of the Grand Historian_, we have the annals of the Wu Emperor, wherein it says:

> 其後三年，有司言元宜以天瑞命，不宜以一二數。一元曰建元，二元以長星曰元光，三元以郊得一角獸曰元狩云。
>
> Three years later, officials suggested that reign periods should be named after heavenly omens, and should not simply use numbers like 'first' and 'second'. The first reign period was called Jianyuan. The second reign period was called Yuanguang due to the appearance of a long star. The third reign period was called Yuanshou because a one-horned beast was encountered during the suburban sacrifice.

So the Yuanguang period was named after a nova. 元 means "first" or "primary", 光 means "light". A "long star" (長星) is obviously a comet.

In the [_Book of Han_][hanbuk] (completed ~111 CE) there is a treatise on astronomy there is this line:

[hanbuk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Han

> 元光元年六月，客星見于房
>
> In the sixth month of the first year of Yuanguang, a guest star appeared in the Fang constellation.

Yuanguang (元光) is an [era] during the reign of the [Emperor Wu of Han][wu], the six-year period from 134 BCE to 129BCE. Fang (房) is one of the [lunar mansions][mansion], corresponding to the constellation [Scorpius]. A "[guest star][guest]" (客星) is a nova. So, in 134 BCE there was a nova in Scorpius.

[era]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_era_names
[wu]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Han
[mansion]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-Eight_Mansions
[Scorpius]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius
[guest]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_star_(astronomy)

The _Records_ were written closer to the event (the author, [Sima Qian][sima], was alive in 134 BCE), and contain two independent mentions of a comet, but no mention of a guest star. The _Book of Han_ was written more than two centuries after the event, and mentions a guest star, but no comet.

# The Encyclopædia Britannica

I found many documents that claim Hipparchus saw his nova specifically in 134 BCE. Some call it "the star of Hipparchus", or "the comet of Hipparchus", some state specifically that it was in Scorpio. Clearly they're associating it with the nova of the Chinese records. But nowhere is this claim sourced. Where does it come from?

I think I know. The 1911 edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_'s [article][ebh] on Hipparchus says:

[ebh]: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hipparchus

> The outburst of a new star in 134 B.C. is stated by Pliny (Hist. nat. ii. 26) to have prompted the preparation of his catalogue of 1080 stars [...]

But this is not true. It is plainly false. Pliny mentions the star, but does not give a date. The _Natural History_, book two, chapter 26, [says][nat26]:

[nat26]: https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/57493/pg57493-images.html#BOOK_II_CHAP_24

> This same Hipparchus, who can never be sufficiently commended, as one who more especially proved the relation of the stars to man, and that our souls are a portion of heaven, discovered a new star that was produced in his own age, and, by observing its motions on the day in which it shone, he was led to doubt whether it does not often happen, that those stars have motion which we suppose to be fixed. And the same individual attempted, what might seem presumptuous even in a deity, viz. to number the stars for posterity and to express their relations by appropriate names; having previously devised instruments, by which he might mark the places and the magnitudes of each individual star. In this way it might be easily discovered, not only whether they were destroyed or produced, but whether they changed their relative positions, and likewise, whether they were increased or diminished; the heavens being thus left as an inheritance to any one, who might be found competent to complete his plan.

Note that Pliny seems to be talking about a comet rather than a supernova, that is, the new star of Hipparchus moved across the sky.

I consulted multiple translations, read the original Latin, searched for any reference to Hipparchus or new stars. Dates back then were given more obliquely, Pliny would have said "in the n-th Olympiad" or "in the consulship of so-and-so". But no dates are given. Where does the date of 134 BCE come from?

The _Britannica_ article cites a number of sources. Most are inconvenient to read, some are impossible to find. But one of them, at least, reproduces the claim.

[Arthur Berry][berry] was a historian of astronomy. His book, [_A Short History of Astronomy_][short] (1898), is among the citations of the _Britannica_ article, and includes this claim:

[berry]: https://www.jstor.org/stable/225698
[short]: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/59212/59212-h/59212-h.htm

> The appearance in 134 B.C. of a new star in the Scorpion is said to have suggested to Hipparchus the construction of a new catalogue of the stars.

But there are no fine-grained citations. Delambre and Tannery mention the _étoile nouvelle_ of Hipparchus, but neither one gives a date. Berry's German sources are unreadable Fraktur gobbledygook. The trail is cold.

But then I found [this paper][newstar] ([PDF][pdf]) from 1919, which says:

> the comet of 134 B.C. has been known to Western scholars since the appearance of Biot’s paper in 1843

[Édouard Biot][biot] was a French astronomer and sinologist. As an astronomer, he could have had the means and motive to read Pliny on Hipparchus. And we know he read the _Records of the Grand Historian_, because in his paper of 1843, _Catalogue des étoiles extraordinaires observées en Chine depuis les temps anciens jusqu'à l'an 1203 de notre ère_, he writes:

[biot]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Biot

> [Avant Jésus-Christ] 134, en juillet (sous _Wou-ti_, de la dynastie Han, période _Youen-kouang_, 1ʳᵉ année, 6ᵉ lune), une étoile extraordinaire parut dans l'astérisme Fang (β, π, ρ Scorpion).

So, Biot publishes his translation in 1843, the information diffuses, and it becomes common knowledge in astronomy to associate the nova of 134 BCE with the nova of Hipparchus. Then in 1898 Berry publishes his book, including the date derived from Chinese sources.
