title: Implementing SM-2 in Rust
summary: An implemenation of the SuperMemo-2 algorithm.
math: yes
---

I've been on a [spaced repetition][sr] (SR) kick as of late. [Mochi], the SR software I use, uses a modified version of the [SuperMemo][sm] [SM-2][sm2] algorithm to schedule cards. The differences are:

1. The ease factor (EF) of the cards is not adjusted in response to performance, but can be changed manually. The justification is this avoids a purported problem with SM-2 called ["ease hell"][eh].
2. When you fail a card, the interval to the next review is not reset but _halved_.

The interval halving I dislike, because sometimes I'll remember a card for the first couple months, then forget it, and enter this weird limbo state where the reviews are not frequent enough for me to re-learn the card, so I start alternately recalling it and failing it.

But I didn't understand the implications of the change to the ease factor. So I decided to look into the algorithm. And, since what I do not create, I do not understand, I wrote a simple implementation of it in Rust.

Without further ado, the code is [here][repo]. What follows is an explanation.

# The Algorithm

Why do we need an algorithm? We could drill every card every day, but this would be a living nightmare, and you could not have more than ~200 flashcards. The scheduler acts as a simple, quantitative model of human memory. The better the model, the more we can commit to long-term memory, and the less time we have to spend studying.

An **item** is an atomic piece of knowledge, represented as a flashcard: a question-answer pair that tests the existence of that knowledge. An item's state is represented by:

1. The **easing factor** $EF$, which is the dual of difficulty. This is a real number in the range $[1.3, +\infty]$. The initial value is $2.5$.
2. The number of **repetitions** $n$, which is the number of times the card has been recalled correctly in a row.

From a card's state, we can calculate its **interval**: the number of days after the most recent test when the item should be reviewed again. The interval calculation is defined by a recurrence relation on the number of repetitions:

$$
\begin{align*}
I(0) &= 0 \\
I(1) &= 1 \\
I(2) &= 6 \\
I(n) &= I(n-1) \times \text{EF}
\end{align*}
$$

The closed-form expression is:

$$
I(n) = 6 \times \text{EF}^{(n-2)}
$$

As a function of correct repetitions and EF:

![A plot of showing how an item's interval evolves as a function of the number of correct repetitions, for different values of EF. Higher EF values grow faster.](/assets/content/implementing-sm2-in-rust/interval.png)

To test an item, the user is shown the question, then they mentally recall the answer, and reveal the actual answer. Then the user rates their performance by selecting the **quality** of their response from this list:

- 0 = Blackout. No recall.
- 1 = Incorrect response; but the answer, once revealed, was remembered.
- 2 = Incorrect response; but the answer seemed easy to recall.
- 3 = Recalled with difficulty.
- 4 = Recalled with hesitation.
- 5 = Recalled perfectly.

Quality values in $[0,2]$ represent **forgetting**.

When an item is tested, and we have a quality, the item's state has to be updated.

If the user forgot the answer, the repetition count is set to zero. This means the interval, too, is reset: you have to relearn the card from scratch.

$$
n'(n, q) = \begin{cases}
0   & q \in [0,2] \\
n+1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The EF is updated by adding a magnitude proportional to the response quality:

$$
\text{EF}'(\text{EF}, q) = min(1.3, \text{EF} + f(q))
$$

Where:

$$
f(q) = -0.8 + 0.28q - 0.02*q^2
$$

Qualitatively, $f(q)$ looks like this:

![](/assets/content/implementing-sm2-in-rust/ef.png)

So for anything less than perfect recall the EF decreases (and so the next interval is shorter), and only perfect recall makes a card less difficult.  At $q=4$ nothing changes.

And so we get ease hell: it is much easier to push EF down, or keep it the same, than to push it up.

The final piece of the algorithm is that, at the end of a review session, all items with quality in $[0, 3]$ should be tested again until all of them have a recall quality in $[4,5]$.

# The Code

Scalar types:

```rust
pub type Repetitions = u32;
pub type Ease = f32;
pub type Interval = u32;
```

Normally I would use newtypes with smart constructors to represent types with ranges (e.g. EF has a minimum value of 1.3). But this would make the code uglier, so instead I just wrote:

```rust
pub const INITIAL_EF: Ease = 2.5;
const MIN_EF: Ease = 1.3;

fn min(ef: Ease) -> Ease {
    if ef < MIN_EF {
        MIN_EF
    } else {
        ef
    }
}
```

Quality is naturally represented as an enum:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Quality {
    /// Complete blackout.
    Blackout = 0,
    /// Incorrect response; the correct one remembered.
    Incorrect = 1,
    /// Incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall.
    IncorrectEasy = 2,
    /// Correct response recalled with serious difficulty.
    Hard = 3,
    /// Correct response after a hesitation.
    Good = 4,
    /// Perfect response.
    Perfect = 5,
}
```

With two predicates, to test whether this quality value implies the forgetting, and whether the item needs to be repeated at the end of the session:

```rust
impl Quality {
    pub fn forgot(self) -> bool {
        match self {
            Self::Blackout
            | Self::Incorrect
            | Self::IncorrectEasy => true,
            Self::Hard | Self::Good | Self::Perfect => {
                false
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn repeat(self) -> bool {
        match self {
            Self::Blackout
            | Self::Incorrect
            | Self::IncorrectEasy
            | Self::Hard => true,
            Self::Good | Self::Perfect => false,
        }
    }
}
```

An item's state is just its values of $n$ and $\text{EF}$ (exact due date timestamps would be implemented outside the system):

```rust
pub struct Item {
    n: Repetitions,
    ef: Ease,
}
```

Given an item, we can calculate its interval:

```rust
impl Item {
    pub fn interval(&self) -> Interval {
        let r = self.n;
        let ef = self.ef;
        match self.n {
            0 => 0,
            1 => 1,
            2 => 6,
            _ => {
                let r = r as f32;
                let i = 6.0 * ef.powf(r - 2.0);
                let i = i.ceil();
                i as u32
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `Item::review` method consumes an item and, given a quality rating, updates its state:

```rust
impl Item {
    pub fn review(self, q: Quality) -> Self {
        Self {
            n: np(self.n, q),
            ef: efp(self.ef, q),
        }
    }
}
```

Where:

```rust
fn np(n: Repetitions, q: Quality) -> Repetitions {
    if q.forgot() {
        0
    } else {
        n + 1
    }
}

fn efp(ef: Ease, q: Quality) -> Ease {
    let ef = min(ef);
    let q = (q as u8) as f32;
    let ef = ef - 0.8 + 0.28 * q - 0.02 * q * q;
    min(ef)
}
```
