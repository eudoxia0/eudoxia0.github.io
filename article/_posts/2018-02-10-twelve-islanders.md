# Statement

There are twelve people on an island, and your task is to mass them. All twelve
of them mass the same, except one, who masses slightly more or less than the
others. You don't know ahead of time whether the odd one out is heavier or
lighter.

To measure them, you have a seesaw, which seats any number of people (but the
same number on both sides). This is a discrete seesaw: either it's horizontal,
or it dips fully in one or the other direction.

You have up to three measurements to find the odd one out, and say whether they
are heavier or lighter.

 * lists are the same length
