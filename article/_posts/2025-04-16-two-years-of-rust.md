- context
  - just finished a job
  - 2y working with rust
  - on b2b saas

# Learning {#learning}

- didn't let rust the usual way
- studied rust, more or less academically, as research for [Austral][au]
- when I started the job I had not written almost anything
- nevertheless I could jump right in

# The Good {#good}

- rust as a better go
- rust as a faster python

## Cargo {#cargo}

## Error Handling {#error}

## Type Safety {#types}

## The Borrow Checker {#borrow}

- fighting the borrow checker doesn't happen
- often, the borrow checker steers you towards designs with mechanical sympathy
- in rare circumstances, you get inscrutable lifetime errors, these often happen when multiple orthogonal features intersect: e.g. closures and async
- often this is a sign you have to simplify

# The Bad {#bad}
