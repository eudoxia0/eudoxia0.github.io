“For man, or for a man, there can be no new beginnings.” — David Zindell, [_Shanidar_][sha]

Re: [A Call for New Aesthetics][call].

At some point in the 20th century, we filled out the last few basis vectors of
humanity. We explored the whole game map. This is what it means to live at the
end of history: every aesthetic movement, political and economic system you can
imagine can be understood as a linear combination of things that have come
before. Asking for a new aesthetics is like asking for a new continent, one
north of 90° and with imaginary longitude.

This is why culture feels stuck, and why every ideology is "neo" or "post"
something that came before: we have exhausted humanity. And this is why every
response to the call for a new aesthetics is to dig up some past artistic
movement, and scale it up linearly. "[We offer nothing new except
gigantism][gig]".

I don't want to believe this is true, because I want to believe culture is an
infinite game, and inexhaustible. And surely the number of linear
combinations---of distinct ideas humans can have, and works of art we can
make---is so high as to be inexhaustible. But each new remixing brings less
information than the last.

> Today, futuristic aesthetics often mean retrofuturistic aesthetics.

At the end of history, all futurism is retrofuturism, because the future is
_contained in_ the past. The space age, the atomic age, the age of supersonic
flight all came and went. Dyson spheres and nanomachines and mind uploading were
theorized and written about decades ago.

If there is a new aesthetic, it will have to come from a transhuman
culture---from people who are more than, or at least other than, human---or from
the [alien minds][sand] being born around us.
