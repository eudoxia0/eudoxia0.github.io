This post is about managing ADHD. It is divided into two sections: "Strategies" describes the high-level control system, "Tactics" is a list of micro-level improvements (really it should be called "strategems", since most are essentially about tricking yourself).

## Task Selection

I don't like the word "prioritize", because it has two subtly different meanings:

- "Weak prioritization" means to sort a list of tasks by some unspecified criterion, that is, to establish an order where some things are prior to another.
- "Strong prioritization" is to sort a list _specifically_ by importance.

"Weak prioritization" is something everyone should do: it takes a moment to go over the todo list and drag the tasks into more or less the order in which you will do them. This keeps the most relevant tasks near the top, which is where your eyes naturally go to.

"Strong prioritization" is, in my view, a bad job scheduling algorithm. Importance alone is not good enough.

Consider the case where you have a very important task A which takes a long time to finish, and a less important task B which takes 5m to finish. For example, writing an essay versus replying to an email. Which should you do first? I would execute B first, because doing so in turn unblocks B's successor tasks. If you reply to the email and then get to work on task A, the other person has time to read your email and reply to you. And the conversation moves forward while you are otherwise engaged.

Of course, the pathological version of this is where you only action the quick wins: all the minute little chores get done instantly, but the big tasks, requiring long periods of concentration, get postponed perpetually.

My task-selection algorithm is basically: do the shortest task first, with two exceptions:

1. Stalled tasks get a priority bump. If I created a task weeks ago, or if I've been postponing in for many days in a row, it has to be done now.
2. Content-dependence: if I'm working on a particular project, I'd rather focus on tasks from that project, rather than from the global todo list.
