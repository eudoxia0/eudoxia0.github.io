This post is about managing ADHD. It is divided into two sections: "Strategies" describes the high-level control system, "Tactics" is a list of micro-level improvements (really it should be called "strategems", since most are essentially about tricking yourself).

## Task Selection

I don't like the word "prioritize", because it has two subtly different meanings:

- "Weak prioritization" means to sort a list of tasks by some unspecified criterion, that is, to establish an order where some things are prior to another.
- "Strong prioritization" is to sort a list _specifically_ by importance.

"Weak prioritization" is something everyone should do: it takes a moment to go over the todo list and drag the tasks into more or less the order in which you will do them. This keeps the most relevant tasks near the top, which is where your eyes naturally go to.

"Strong prioritization" is, in my view, a bad job scheduling algorithm. Importance alone is not good enough.

Consider the case where you have a very important task A which takes a long time to finish, and a less important task B which takes 5m to finish. For example, writing an essay versus replying to an email. Which should you do first? I would execute B first, because doing so in turn unblocks B's successor tasks. If you reply to the email and then get to work on task A, the other person has time to read your email and reply to you. And the conversation moves forward while you are otherwise engaged.

Of course, the pathological version of this is where you only action the quick wins: all the minute little chores get done instantly, but the big tasks, requiring long periods of concentration, get postponed perpetually.

My task-selection algorithm is basically: do the shortest task first, with two exceptions:

1. Stalled tasks get a priority bump. If I created a task weeks ago, or if I've been postponing in for many days in a row, it has to be done now.
2. Content-dependence: if I'm working on a particular project, I'd rather focus on tasks from that project, rather than from the global todo list.

## Visual Field Management

Out of sight, out of mind. The corollary: to keep something in mind, put it in your visual field; to keep it out, leave it out.

My desk is very spartan: there's a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard, and a few trinkets. My desktop is empty. There are no files in it. The dock has only the apps I use frequently. And at a higher level, I try to keep the apartment very clean and orderly. Because everything that's out of place is a distraction, visual noise. That's the negative aspect: the things I remove.

The positive aspect, the things I keep in my visual field: most of the time, I have two windows open on my computer the todo list occupies the left third of the screen, the right two-thirds are occupied by whatever window I have open at the time, e.g.:

TODO SCREENSHOT

And so at a glance, I can see:

1. What I'm currently working on
2. What I will work on next
3. The list of active projects, so that I don't forget they exist.

## Inbox Zero

You have probably heard of inbox zero. It sounds like LinkedIn-tier advice. But if you struggle with comms, with replying to people in a timely manner (or at all), inbox zero is a good strategy. There are two reasons, briefly:

- Inbox zero has no false negatives: if an inbox is empty, you know you've handled everything.
- Important communications have a way of "camouflaging" themselves among irrelevance.

And, like everything: before you make it into a habit, it feels incredibly time-consuming and labour-intensive. But once you make it into a habit, it's almost effortless.

So, I will give you an example. I come in to work, and read four emails. Three could've been archived outright, one needed a reply from me. And I said, oh, I'll get to it in a second. And then I got distracted with other tasks. And throughout the day I kept glancing at the email client, and thinking, yeah, I will get to it. Eventually I got used to those four emails: they are the "new normal", and what's normal doesn't require action. I would think: if those emails are there, and I already looked at them, then it's probably fine. At the end of the day I looked at the inbox again and saw, wait, no, one of those emails was actually important. That's the failure mode of inbox greater-than-zero: the important stuff hides among the irrelevant stuff, such that a quick glance at the todo list doesn't show anything obviously wrong. Dually, with inbox zero, if you see a single email in the inbox, you know there's work to do.

Inbox zero removes ambiguity. If there's _anything_ in the inbox, you know, unambiguously, you have a task to complete. If there is nothing in the inbox, you know, unambiguously, there is nothing to do. Inbox zero frees you from false negatives, where you think you've handled your correspondence but there's some important email, camouflaged among the trivial ones, that has not been replied to.

A problem with doing inbox zero is most communication apps (like Discord, Slack, iMessage etc.) don't have a concept of an inbox, just the read/unread flag on conversations. Since there's no separation between the inbox and the archive, it takes more discipline to ensure every conversation is replied to.

## Inbox Bankruptcy

By the time I started to become organized I'd already accumulated thousands of bookmarks, unread emails, files in my downloads folder, papers in my physical inbox, etc. It would have been a Herculean effort to file these things away. So I didn't. All the disorganized files, I wrapped them up in a folder and threw them in my `Attic` folder. Emails? Archived. Bookmarks? Exported to HTML, archived the export, and deleted them from the browser.

Ideally you should do this once, at the start.

And by archiving things rather than deleting them, you leave open the possibility that as some point in the future, you might be able to action some of those things. Triage the old bookmarks, sort your filesystem, etc.

## Using OCD to Defeat ADHD

In a sense, having a really complex productivity system is like trying to use OCD to defeat ADHD, to use high neuroticism to defeat low conscientiousness. There's an element of truth to that, sure (see mastery of drudgery).

But here's the thing: you have to play to your strengths. You have to. If you are very OCD and you like order and systems and planning but you struggle with doing, then, yeah, it might work, for you, to spend more energy on the trappings of productivity (ensuring your todo list is properly formatted, organized, etc.) if that bleeds over into making it easier to do the real, meaningful things.

For example: I like emojis in my todo list. The chores have a üßº emoji, the comms tasks have an ‚úâÔ∏è emoji. That kind of thing. Makes it easy to see at a glance what kind of things I have to do, to group them by category. But Todoist doesn't support emoji icons on tasks, unlike Notion, so adding the emojis takes a bit more effort: I have to open [Raycast] and search for the emoji I want and paste it into the task title. It adds a little friction each time I create a task, but the benefit is I enjoy using the todo list more.
