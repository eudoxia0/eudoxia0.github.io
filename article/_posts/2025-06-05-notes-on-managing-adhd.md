This post is about managing ADHD. It is divided into two sections: "Strategies" describes the high-level control system, "Tactics" is a list of micro-level improvements (really it should be called "strategems", since most are essentially about tricking yourself).

## Timers

If you have ADHD you've probably heard of the Pomodoro method, tried it, and bounced off it. The way it's framed is very neurotypical: it's scaffolding around _doing_, but ADHD people often have problems with the doing itself. And so the scaffolding is kind of pointless.

The method works well in three kinds of contexts:

- **Overcoming Aversion:** when you have a large number of microtasks, each of which takes a few seconds to a few minutes, but the number of them, and the uncertainty factor, makes the sum seem a lot larger. A classic example for me is having to reply to like ten different people. Realistically, each person can be handled in 15s. One or two might require a couple of minutes to compose a longer reply. But often I will avoid those tasks like the plague and drag them across the entire day.

  The pomodoro method works here because you're basically trading (up to) 25m of pain for an entire day's peace and quiet. So you get all the annoying little tasks together, start a timer, and go through them. And usually you're done in maybe ten minutes. And you feel _really_ good after, because all those annoying little tasks are done.

  It really is amazing what a little bit of fake urgency can do.

- **Starting:** sometimes the problem is just starting. It is very trite, but it's true. You have something you _want to want_ to do, but don't _want_ to do. I want to want to read this book, to learn this topic, to write this blog post, to work on this software project. But I don't _want_ to do it. The pomodoro method helps you start.

  You're not comitting to finishing the project. You're not comitting to months or weeks or days or even hours of work. You're comitting to a half hour. And if you work just that half hour: great, promise kept. 30m a day, over the course of a single month, is 15h of work. And often I start a 30m timer and end up working four hours, and maybe that's a good outcome.

- **Stopping:** dually, sometimes the problem is stopping. If you're trying to advance multiple projects at the same time, if you hyperfocus on one, it eats into the time you allocated for the others. And more broadly, spending too much time on one project can derail all your plans for the day. Maybe you meant to go to the gym at 6pm but you got so stuck in with this project that it's 8:30pm and you're still glued to the screen. So the gym suffers, your sleep schedule suffers, etc.

  Actually stopping when the pomodoro timer goes off can prevent excessive single-mindedness.

  Additionally, the five-minute break at the end of the pomodoro block is useful. It's a time to get up from the computer, unround your shoulders, practice mindfulness, essentially, all those little things that you want to do a few times throughout the day.

# Tactics

Strategems, tricks.

## Task Selection

I don't like the word "prioritize", because it has two subtly different meanings:

- "Weak prioritization" means to sort a list of tasks by some unspecified criterion, that is, to establish an order where some things are prior to another.
- "Strong prioritization" is to sort a list _specifically_ by importance.

"Weak prioritization" is something everyone should do: it takes a moment to go over the todo list and drag the tasks into more or less the order in which you will do them. This keeps the most relevant tasks near the top, which is where your eyes naturally go to.

"Strong prioritization" is, in my view, a bad job scheduling algorithm. Importance alone is not good enough.

Consider the case where you have a very important task A which takes a long time to finish, and a less important task B which takes 5m to finish. For example, writing an essay versus replying to an email. Which should you do first? I would execute B first, because doing so in turn unblocks B's successor tasks. If you reply to the email and then get to work on task A, the other person has time to read your email and reply to you. And the conversation moves forward while you are otherwise engaged.

Of course, the pathological version of this is where you only action the quick wins: all the minute little chores get done instantly, but the big tasks, requiring long periods of concentration, get postponed perpetually.

My task-selection algorithm is basically: do the shortest task first, with two exceptions:

1. Stalled tasks get a priority bump. If I created a task weeks ago, or if I've been postponing in for many days in a row, it has to be done now.
2. Content-dependence: if I'm working on a particular project, I'd rather focus on tasks from that project, rather than from the global todo list.

## Visual Field Management

Out of sight, out of mind. The corollary: to keep something in mind, put it in your visual field; to keep it out, leave it out.

My desk is very spartan: there's a monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard, and a few trinkets. My desktop is empty. There are no files in it. The dock has only the apps I use frequently. And at a higher level, I try to keep the apartment very clean and orderly. Because everything that's out of place is a distraction, visual noise. That's the negative aspect: the things I remove.

The positive aspect, the things I keep in my visual field: most of the time, I have two windows open on my computer the todo list occupies the left third of the screen, the right two-thirds are occupied by whatever window I have open at the time, e.g.:

TODO SCREENSHOT

And so at a glance, I can see:

1. What I'm currently working on
2. What I will work on next
3. The list of active projects, so that I don't forget they exist.

## Centralize Your Inboxes

## Inbox Zero

You have probably heard of inbox zero. It sounds like LinkedIn-tier advice. But if you struggle with comms, with replying to people in a timely manner (or at all), inbox zero is a good strategy. There are two reasons, briefly:

- Inbox zero has no false negatives: if an inbox is empty, you know you've handled everything.
- Important communications have a way of "camouflaging" themselves among irrelevance.

And, like everything: before you make it into a habit, it feels incredibly time-consuming and labour-intensive. But once you make it into a habit, it's almost effortless.

So, I will give you an example. I come in to work, and read four emails. Three could've been archived outright, one needed a reply from me. And I said, oh, I'll get to it in a second. And then I got distracted with other tasks. And throughout the day I kept glancing at the email client, and thinking, yeah, I will get to it. Eventually I got used to those four emails: they are the "new normal", and what's normal doesn't require action. I would think: if those emails are there, and I already looked at them, then it's probably fine. At the end of the day I looked at the inbox again and saw, wait, no, one of those emails was actually important. That's the failure mode of inbox greater-than-zero: the important stuff hides among the irrelevant stuff, such that a quick glance at the todo list doesn't show anything obviously wrong. Dually, with inbox zero, if you see a single email in the inbox, you know there's work to do.

Inbox zero removes ambiguity. If there's _anything_ in the inbox, you know, unambiguously, you have a task to complete. If there is nothing in the inbox, you know, unambiguously, there is nothing to do. Inbox zero frees you from false negatives, where you think you've handled your correspondence but there's some important email, camouflaged among the trivial ones, that has not been replied to.

A problem with doing inbox zero is most communication apps (like Discord, Slack, iMessage etc.) don't have a concept of an inbox, just the read/unread flag on conversations. Since there's no separation between the inbox and the archive, it takes more discipline to ensure every conversation is replied to.

## Inbox Bankruptcy

By the time I started to become organized I'd already accumulated thousands of bookmarks, unread emails, files in my downloads folder, papers in my physical inbox, etc. It would have been a Herculean effort to file these things away. So I didn't. All the disorganized files, I wrapped them up in a folder and threw them in my `Attic` folder. Emails? Archived. Bookmarks? Exported to HTML, archived the export, and deleted them from the browser.

Ideally you should do this once, at the start.

And by archiving things rather than deleting them, you leave open the possibility that as some point in the future, you might be able to action some of those things. Triage the old bookmarks, sort your filesystem, etc.

## Do It On Your Own Terms

If you're averse to doing something, for emotional reasons, one way to overcome the aversion is to do it as much as possible on your own terms.

An example: you have to fill out some government form. You're averse to it because you worry about making a mistake. And just the thought of opening the form fills you with dread. So, take the boxes in the form, and make a spreadsheet for them. If fonts/colours/emojis/etc. if that makes it feel more personal, or like something you designed and created. Then fill out the form in the spreadsheet. And then copy the values to the form and submit.

This helps because instead of performing the task in this external domain where you feel threatened, you're performing the task in your own domain, in your own terms.

Another example: you have an email you have to reply to, and you're anxious about it. Just opening the email client gives you a bad feeling. Instead, try composing the email elsewhere, say, in a text editor. The change of environment changes the emotional connotation: you're not replying to an email, you're writing a text. You might even think of it as a work of fiction, a pseudoepigraphy.

## Replace Interrupts with Polling

TODO

## Accountability Buddy

If you're struggling to work on something, work next to another person. Set a timer and tell them what you're going to accomplish and when the timer ends tell them how you did. Just being around other people can make it easier to overcome aversion. This is why coworking spaces are useful.

If you don't have a person around, you might try [Focusmate]. It works for [some people][parker].

Sometimes I'll start a conversation with Claude, lay out my plans for the day, and update Claude as I do things. If I'm stuck, or if I need help overcoming procrastination, I can ask Claude for help, and it's easier to do that in an on-going thread because Claude already has the necessary context, so I don't have to describe what I'm struggling with _ab initio_.

## Using OCD to Defeat ADHD

In a sense, having a really complex productivity system is like trying to use OCD to defeat ADHD, to use high neuroticism to defeat low conscientiousness. There's an element of truth to that, sure (see mastery of drudgery).

But here's the thing: you have to play to your strengths. You have to. If you are very OCD and you like order and systems and planning but you struggle with doing, then, yeah, it might work, for you, to spend more energy on the trappings of productivity (ensuring your todo list is properly formatted, organized, etc.) if that bleeds over into making it easier to do the real, meaningful things.

For example: I like emojis in my todo list. The chores have a 🧼 emoji, the comms tasks have an ✉️ emoji. That kind of thing. Makes it easy to see at a glance what kind of things I have to do, to group them by category. But Todoist doesn't support emoji icons on tasks, unlike Notion, so adding the emojis takes a bit more effort: I have to open [Raycast] and search for the emoji I want and paste it into the task title. It adds a little friction each time I create a task, but the benefit is I enjoy using the todo list more.

## The Master of Drudgery

A productivity antipattern: indulging too much in "quick wins".

There's this running joke, or meme, online, about the kind of person who has this huge, colossal productivity system, but they get nothing done. They have five todo list apps and everything is categorized and indexed and sorted, but their material output is zero. They complete a hundred tasks a day and when you interrogate what those tasks are they are "brush my teeth" or "reorganize my bookshelf". There's a lot of truth to that.

Every task falls into one of two categories: the quick wins, and everything else. Life is not made of quick wins. Creative, generative, open-ended work requires long periods of focused work. A lot of unpleasant, aversion-causing things have to be done. But the quick wins are infinite: there's always some micro-chore to do around the house, for example.

## Put Travel in the Calendar

I am chronically late. So if I have a calendar event like a party at someone's home, I will go on Google Maps and measure the travel time (from my home or wherever I'm likely to be) to the destination, and make a time block for that. e.g., if it takes 30m to go to the dentist and back, this is what my calendar looks like:

![](/assets/content/notes-on-managing-adhd/travel.png)

This ensures I leave my home on time. If it's something especially important I often add 15m to the travel block as a buffer.
