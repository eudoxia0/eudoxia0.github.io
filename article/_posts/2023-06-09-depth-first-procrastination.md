I want to train a neural network.

So first I must learn the theory---read a textbook, [ankify it][sr]. But to
understand the math I must first learn probability and statistics in
depth. Frequentism or Bayesianism? I heard really good things about
[Jaynes][jaynes]. Do I have the mathematical maturity? Maybe I should revise,
say, set theory. The proofs in this textbook are very hard to read, so I rewrite
them and make them more formal and refactor them into lemmas small enough to put
into spaced repetition. They're starting to look like [Fitch
notation][fitch]. Maybe I can write my proofs in first-order logic? Learning
logic might give me a stronger foundation for doing proofs. But what is logic,
really?

Somewhere in another Everett branch, a more sensible version of me is doing a
PyTorch tutorial while I read [Quine][quine] on what is or isn't an ontological
commitment in a first-order theory. I have six [SEP][sep] tabs open, and I still
don't know what a ReLU is.

I call it depth-first procrastination. You start with a high-level goal, and
rather than taking the optimal route, a combination of intellectual curiosity
and anxiety about standing on shaky foundations leads you to spawn subgoal after
subgoal after subgoal, until you hit rock bottom and you find yourself doing
some task so distantly related to the original goal you're in another universe
entirely. See also: [yak shaving][yak], [OCD][ocd].

I do this all the time: I learned to program because I wanted to write a program
to write novels in. And while I never did do that, I did [invent my own
programming language][au]. In college I spent more time [writing note-taking
software][tft] than taking notes.

The upside of this is you learn self-reliance, and you learn foundational
knowledge others might not. The downside is by the time you pop the stack back
up to the top you're old and dead.

And it's always bullshit. Labouring in obscurity on some grandiose scheme for
years is overrated. Tighten the feedback loop: trim the fat, ship, react,
iterate. Do or die.
