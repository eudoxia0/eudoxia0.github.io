    - thought i might give my two cents
    - austral compiler was ported from sml to ocaml almost two years ago
- main points
    - syntax
    - conservative ocaml
        - my ocaml vs. all the ocaml i see in the wild
    - ppx
    - at least it's not haskell
    - how the fuck do i profile
    - docs are useless if i can't find them
    - tooling
        - kinda works sometimes
    - modules: better is worse
        - what they are
        - modules hide too much
        - equality is a special case
            - shows things are bad
            - have the courage of your convictions
        - implicit specialization is good
        - integer ordering by divisibility
    - perry's comments
    - the attic
    - compare returns an int
