title: Two Years of OCaml
---

- intro
    - the other day I saw this post: <https://osa1.net/posts/2023-04-24-ocaml-thoughts.html>
        - discussed on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35699697
        - and lobsters: https://lobste.rs/s/jvxb8s/my_thoughts_on_ocaml
    - thought i might give my two cents
        - my experience using ocaml for the past two years
        - how it compares to standard ml
        - how it compares to haskell
    - austral compiler was ported from sml to ocaml almost two years ago
- main points
    - syntax
        - de gustibus yadda yadda
            - I am not a partisan about syntax.
            - I genuinely think C, Java, Lisp, Pascal and ML can be beautiful in their own ways.
        - ML syntax feels like it's "hanging in the air"
        - declaration order
            - and chains are bad
        - currying is bad
            - You can avoid it with tuples but it makes type annotations harder
        - awkward comment syntax
        - type annotation syntax
        - semicolons work sometimes
        - inconsistency
            - make everything delimited
        - nested match statements
            - which appear everywhere
            - have to be parenthesized, so larger functions end up looking lisp-ish with a chain of close parentheses at the end
                - you can avoid this by refactoring each match into a separate function, but then you get the long and chains
        - vs. haskell
            - Haskell is better:
                - separating type annotations
                - less custom syntax
                - no declaration order
                - fine-grained imports
            - Haskell is worse:
                - those dreadful infix operators
                - indentation sensitivity
    - conservative ocaml
        - my ocaml vs. all the ocaml i see in the wild
    - ppx
    - at least it's not haskell
    - how the fuck do i profile
    - docs are useless if i can't find them
    - tooling
        - kinda works sometimes
    - modules: better is worse
        - what they are
        - modules hide too much
        - equality is a special case
            - shows things are bad
            - have the courage of your convictions
        - implicit specialization is good
        - integer ordering by divisibility
        - ad-hoc or generic
            - unclear when to use generic types and when to specialize
    - perry's comments
    - the attic
        - all sorts of language features
    - compare returns an int
- When to use OCaml?
