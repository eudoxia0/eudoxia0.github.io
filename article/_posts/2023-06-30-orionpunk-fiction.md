Genre names are typically coined retrospectively, sometimes after the definitive
work in a genre seals it shut. [Solarpunk][solar] is a strange inversion of
this: it's less a genre and more of a request for genre. There are more people
listing "solarpunk" as an interest in their Twitter bio than there are solarpunk
works of art. By and large the entire trove of solarpunk art is a [Chobani
advertisement][ad] and [this picture][ib]:

And I figure I can do it too.

Orionpunk is fiction along the lines of [Orion's Arm][oa]: hard science fiction
set in a transhuman setting; without FTL, without aliens (except the ones we
make ourselves into), spanning vast gulfs of time and space.

1. **Hard Science:** out of basic respect for the audience. Because otherwise
   it's fake. And because constraints liberate and liberties constrain, and
   overwhelmingly hard SF is more imaginative than "Golden Age" hyperdrive and
   ray gun slop.

1. **No FTL:** because it's a cheap hack for unimagniative writers and
   unimaginative readers.

1. **No Aliens:** because we are alone in the universe, as all the available
   observational evidence says. There are no grays and no ancient bullshit
   precursor species that settled the galaxy and died out so that all the aliens
   are human actors with shit on their forehead. No, our descendants will be
   infinitely more alien.  bullshit precursor species

1. **Transhumanism:** because there are many ways to be a person. Because people
   will live for hundreds of thousands of years, and their values and societies
   will be alien to us.

1. **Big Numbers:** because when you think rigorously about tech you realize the
   carrying capacity of a star is tens of quadrillions of people, that
   self-replicating machines can dismantle planets in days, etc.

1. **Deep Time:** what does society look like, when computers are as old to the
   people in it as writing is to us?

1. **Posthuman Intelligence:** along the lines of Lem, Solaris, His Master's
   Voice, vast and incomprehensible machine minds whose minds are larger than
   the stars.
