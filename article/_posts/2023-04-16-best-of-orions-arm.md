title: The Best of Orionâ€™s Arm
summary: Summarizing ten thousand years of future history.
---

There are two types of fandom: the creative and the systematizing[^tumblr]. The creatives write fan fiction and draw fan art, the systematizers write the huge wikis, like Star Wars' [Wookiepedia][wookie] or Star Trek's [Memory Alpha][mem], where everything down to the life story of the cobbler who made Han Solo's boots is neatly documented. But the franchise comes first: the books or the movies or TV show form the canon from which the facts are extracted and catalogued.

The [Orion's Arm Universe Project][oa] is a wiki without a franchise: it is a vast, sprawling, Borgesian wiki documenting the next ten thousand years of posthuman history. It's been going twenty years, I've been reading it on and off since I was a teenager, since around 2009, and every time I visit the website I'll find some article I've never read, scroll down, and see that it was published in 2001. The ratio of worldbuilding to storytelling is the highest of anything like it other than maybe [SCP][scp]: there are a few stories, here and there, but the overwhelming majority of the content is in the form of wiki entries, describing history, places, technology, factions and science.

It's mostly---for the first few thousand years, at least---hard science fiction, and it's been a huge influence on how I view the future. The technologies and their consequences to the development of civilization are described so rigorously that it leaves little room for argument. The great thing about hard science fiction is it's basically physics plus repeated application of [_modus ponens_][mp]: two authors, starting with the same knowledge of physical law, and thinking with equal rigour, will reach more or less identical conclusions, because reality overconstrains everything.

The setting of Orion's Arm is a vast, diverse galactic ecology, where baseline humans, transhumans, posthumans, uplifted animals, artificial intelligences all live in distinct ecological niches. A small number of incomprehensibly posthuman intelligences, the [archailects][archai], sit at the evolutionary apex. Terragen (Earth-originated) intelligence has settled a roughly spherical volume [14,000 light years across][sphere], and made the universe into a garden. It's a refreshing change from the misanthropy and catastrophism of most popular science fiction.

The worldbuilding of [_The Epiphany of Gliese 581_][eog581] was heavily inspired by the setting of Orion's Arm. In fact, other than when choosing the place names and the names of the characters and the details of culture, I never felt that I was worldbuilding. Most of the tech tree is Orion's Arm-inspired, except for the more speculative stuff like wormholes and reactionless propulsion.

This article is an index of my favorite topics from the Orion's Arm wiki.

## Technology

- [The Argus Array][argus]: a vast interferometric telescope, made up of thousands of individual telescopes spread out across a thousand light year-wide volume. Each telescope is a supercooled black sphere 20AU across, absorption photons in every frequency, for a combined light gathering area of 10<sup>27</sup> m<sup>2</sup>.

  >... the light emitted from a one metre, sunlit object in Andromeda is sufficient to build an image in the Argus Array over a period of three standard years. Larger objects can be imaged more quickly- at the same distance, a 10km object can be seen by collecting photons over a period of just 10 seconds. This allows large-scale phenomena to be observed on the surfaces of planets, such as weather patterns"

## Concepts

- [Artificially Optimised Galaxies][artgal]: distant galaxies that alien species have optimized for long-term habitation, using the stars' own power to starlift hydrogen into gas giants and brown dwarfs, so it can be burned efficiently (in fusion or conversion reactors) and last far longer than stellar fusion.

[artgal]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/552d31f1832b6

- [Toposophy][topos]: the study of posthuman intelligence and enhancement. Also:
  - [Toposophic Levels and Mental Abilities][topolevel]: description of each toposophic level.
  - [Ascension Maze][maze]: a series of challenges that requires you to become posthuman in order to surmount them.

- [Lazurogenics][lazarus]: recreation of extinct species from the genetic, fossil, or historical record.

## Places

- [Duxed][duxed]: a moon of a gas giant with an extreme tidal range, with tides reaching two kilometers up.

[duxed]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/5f01de4e81446

- [Wadai][wadai]: a small ringworld around the white dwarf Eggen-Greenstein 471, built entirely without exotic matter and held together by dynamic compression members.

[wadai]: https://orionsarm.com/eg-article/4910e5c60edcc

- [The Giant Ring of the Archsaur][greatring]: a very large ringworld under construction. 22AU radius, 2.5 million kilometers wide. Built by a civilization of [lazurogened][lazarus] [transapient dinosaurs][dinos].

## Alien Civilizations

Much of this was merged from another world-building project from the early 2000's, the website of the [Hamilton Institute of Exopalentology][hamilton], which was [translated into Orion's Arm][hamiltonoa] ith the name intact.

The alien civilizations and artifacts are some of my favorite content from Orion's Arm, despite being the most speculative. This is the part of the worldbuilding with the highest concentration of Lovecraftian horror.

- [Asoka's Pillar][asoka]: a cylindrical Dyson shell around a lone star floating high above the galaxy, broadcasting a signal saying it is the center of a vast galaxy-spanning empire. If such an empire existed, it no longer does. Perhaps it never did. Who broadcasts the message? An automated system? A mad superintelligence?

[asoka]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/45f9afa70edf7

- [The Empire of Screaming Skulls][skulls]: this has to be my favorite. An alien species in a galaxy 200 million light years away, known only from remote observations. Their space habitats are shaped like the head of an insect, with four empty eye sockets and mandible-like appendages. They are observed in pairs, orbiting their common barycenter and facing each other.

[skulls]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/5b6c19138bd87

- [Black Acropolis][ba]: an abandoned Dyson swarm built by an extinct alien civilization.

[ba]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/48000db9a9c2f

- [SMBH Civilisation][smbh]: an alien civilization, living around the black hole at the center of a galaxy 200 million light years away. Around the black hole are over a million artificial planets, orbiting one after the other in hundrends of distinct orbits, like a Bohr atom, and each moves at 5% of the speed of light.

[smbh]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/5bab765b00ec3

- [Daidarabotchi Megadyson][mega]: fourteen billion light years away, a Dyson shell almost 300 light years in diameter, moving at half the speed of light, a centikelvin above the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. Occasionally a star punches a hole through it, and the shell rebuilds itself in place.

[mega]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/60c7ae5e7df97

- [Leo Hyperobject 1][leo]: an artificial object in a galaxy 300 million light years away, twice the mass of the Milky Way, 1.2 light years in diameter.

[leo]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/5a16e43cac9ad

- [The Deep Traveler][deep]: a Dyson shell, millions of light years away, moving at half the speed of light through intergalactic space.

[deep]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/464790150c74d

- [The Triangulum Transmission][triang]: an alien transmission describing the civilizations of the Triangulum galaxy, and a warning.

[triang]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4802acd634205

- [Dead Drifter][dead]: a dead alien in a space suit, dated to 190 megayears before present, the holotype of an extinct alien species known only from this single space burial.

[dead]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/56d431838762d

- [Makers][makers]: an extinct alien species, the first to be discovered by humans, in the form of a derelict probe floating near Epsilon Sculptoris.

[makers]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4b6d2e7446c5a

- [HIE-236-PPE][khitai]: an extinct alien species known only from their efforts to terraform various planets into Titan-like ecologies. Nothing else is known about them.

[khitai]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4a646e52ca80b

- [Batholith Civilization][bath]: an extinct alien civilization whose planet was irradiated by a gamma ray burst. They took refuge in tunnels in a granite batholith, and gradually died out.

[bath]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4f43b87a30aae

- [Oceanus Ultimata][ocean]: ringworld + waterworld. A dense ring of immense water droplets floating around a star, protected from vacuum by membranes of nanotechnology. They bump and merge and come apart and are filled with alien life.

[ocean]: https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/490b3010a681a

- [The Trader][trader]: a fleet of six alien spacecraft traveling in close formation, using a [Lorentz force tether][tether] to travel in a circular trajectory around the galaxy.
