Let me prefix this by saying that none of this is medical advice, I'm just an autistic man with a lot of free time. If you have mental health problems, for the love of God just talk to a psychiatrist. I promise it's not bad. I am extremely pro-psychiatry and I love the pharmaceutical industry. That aside, let's begin.

# An Epiphany

I have a funny story of how I realized I have ADHD.

In late 2017 I started taking [fluvoxamine][flv] for anxiety. It helped, but partially, so the psychiatrist added [aripiprazole][ari], an atypical antipsychotic which is sometimes used as an [adjuvant][adj] to SSRIs.

[flv]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvoxamine
[ari]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole
[adj]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant

I had to quit after a week because I had [Parkinsonian tremors][eps] (it turns out that fluvoxamine inhibits the [cytochrome][cyp3a4] that metabolizes aripiprazole so I was getting an effectively higher dose). But that was the most productive week I'd had in ages. Suddenly, after _years_ of burnout, I had the mental energy and motivation to _do things_. I resumed work on my [personal projects][gh]. I stopped procrastinating. I was studying things that interest me. I felt like the person I am.

[cyp3a4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4

I told this to three psychiatrists but none of them seemed to think it was meaningful. One of them offered to restart me on aripiprazole, but I didn't want to risk [tardive dyskinesia][td]. So I went back to being a lazy bum.

[td]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia

Years later, while going down an autistic special interest rabbithole, I got interested pharmacology. I bought a copy of [_Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience_][molneuro]. And I didn't read it (because I didn't have the executive function) but I did leaf through it. And in the first chapter I read about how [partial agonists][pagonist] drugs work.

[molneuro]: https://neurology.mhmedical.com/book.aspx?bookID=2963
[pagonist]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist

Briefly: low dopamine activity makes you ADHD, high dopamine activity makes you schizophrenic. That's why stimulants (which increase dopamine) can cause psychosis. A partial agonist of dopamine acts as an agonist (dopamine ↑) when dopamine is low, but acts as an antagonist (dopamine ↓) when dopamine is high. In short: partial agonists are stabilizers. Aripiprazole is a partial agonist of dopamine.

And I had an epiphany. And I looked it up: can Aripiprazole be used to treat ADHD? I found a [case report][case] report of a woman with ADHD who was treated with aripiprazole, she reported exactly what I experienced, down to the daytime sleepiness. I found a [clinical trial][trial] where aripiprazole was successfully used for ADHD.

[case]: https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/11/3/439/761618
[trial]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18759644/

This was 2022. It took me four years to figure it out (it turns out it's hard to solve problems when you keep getting distracted from them). But who can say they've diagnosed themselves from first principles after an unusual reaction to a drug?

I talked about it with friends who have ADHD. I showed my psychiatrist the [Austral commit log][log]: tall, narrow peaks of hyperfocus separated by long stretches of inactivity.

# What Didn't Work

I resent when people say to stop taking pills because the solution to [insert mental health] problem is exercise. First, because I can outlift everyone who tells me that, and secondly because I feel that it confuses cause and effect. If someone has crippling depression, and they start a rigorous exercise routine, that might just mean they've spontaneously entered remission. So if your anxiety or whatever can be handled by exercise and drinking a mango smoothie: good for you. Please don't tell me about it.

Here's the things that didn't help with my ADHD: todo lists, the [X effect][xeffect], Vipassana meditation, lifting, cardio, methylated vitamin B12, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, keto, carnivore, vegetarian, generic talk therapy. More generally: pharmacology is the only thing that's even changed anything for me, and the "classical" or non-pharmacological approaches only become useful _with_ pharmacological assistance.

[xeffect]: https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/

Concretely: it was only after I started taking Bupropion that I was able to use a todo list consistently, that I was able to make [spaced repetition][sr] into a daily habit, that I was able to build up productive habits and practices.

[sr]: /article/effective-spaced-repetition

My mental model of this is: when your reward function is just $f(x) = 0$, putting effort on a productive task gives you as much reward as putting no effort at all, or procrastinating on some instant-gratification Skinner box. Habit formation becomes impossible. You might manage to use a todo list consistently for a week, or two weeks, but eventually something happens that breaks that streak, and you find that despite repeated effort, you have not formed a habit. The associations in your brain simply _are not there_.

Bupropion's effects are very muted---it is a _very_ mild stimulant---but it gave me just enough of a bump to my reward function that I was able to start consciously building good habits.

  
# Bupropion

- pharmacology
  - NDRI
  - clinical guidelines
    - increasing effectiveness
    - decreasing safety
    - because of how the monoamine system works
  - extended release forms
    - Australia only has SR
    - SR twice daily is more powerful than SR once daily
    - takes time to reach steady state
    - the thing though is you have to take them 8h apart
      - that causes insomnia
      - in aus unfortunately you only have the SR version

# Effects

- effects
  - less anxiety
  - less negative intrusive thoughts
  - no bad days
  - a bit more productive
  - anhedonia
  - able to deploy todo lists
  - accomplishments
    - not immediate
    - but gradual

# Side Effects

- things i experienced
  - rash
    - discontinued
    - antihistamine
  - appetite
    - anorectic
  - insomnia
    - first day, insomnia
    - twice-daily dosing schedule
    
- things i did not experience:
  - some people it makes more depressed
    - two people at least
  - alcohol
    - lowers seizure threshold
  - on seizure risk
    - lowers seizure threshold
    - recount history here
    - dose-dependent
      - sustained and extended release formulations have less risk because the peak of the curve is flatter
