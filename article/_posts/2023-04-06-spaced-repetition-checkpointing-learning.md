tl;dr write flashcards when you read, drill them every day, and you get effective autodidactism without needing extreme executive functioning.

I love learning. But I'm also very scatterbrained. So in a typical year I would start reading dozens of textbooks on all sorts of different topics, make it one to three chapters in---and drop them. If I took notes, I'd forget to review them. So most of the effort was wasted. And if I later resumed a book, I had to start from scratch.

Even after starting an otherwise very successful [ADHD treatment][bup], this problem[^problem] persisted. And while I haven't entirely solved it, I have found a way to mitigate the downside and keep the upside.

The solution is [spaced repetition][sr]. While reading each chapter of a technical book, I'll write lots of spaced repetition flashcards. I rarely take long-form notes anymore, since those usually end up being just a scratchpad that I later rewrite into flashcards.

And then I drill them. And if priorities or life circumstances or distraction cause me to put a book down, I will remember what I read. And if, weeks or months later, I decide to resume the book, I am able to continue where I left off.

Making spaced repetition into a habit lets me have the best of both worlds: I can read widely and zero in on my [special interest][si] du jour, and drop it when the next interesting thing comes along, and still make tangible progress.

The [next post][next] will be about how I learnt to use spaced repetition effectively.

    And I don't, entirely, see it as a problem. Broad, survey knowledge can be useful as the explore phase of [explore-exploit][ee], and not all knowledge is worth acquiring in depth.
