Let me prefix this by saying that none of this is medical advice, I'm just an
autistic man with a lot of free time. If you have mental health problems, for
the love of God just talk to a psychiatrist. I promise it's not bad. I am
extremely pro-psychiatry and I love the pharmaceutical industry. That aside,
let's begin.

# An Epiphany

I have a funny story of how I realized I have ADHD.

In late 2017 I started taking [fluvoxamine][flv] for anxiety. It helped, but
partially, so the psychiatrist added [aripiprazole][ari], an atypical
antipsychotic which is sometimes used as an [adjuvant][adj] to SSRIs.

[flv]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvoxamine
[ari]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole
[adj]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant

I had to quit after a week because I had [Parkinsonian tremors][eps] (it turns
out that fluvoxamine inhibits the [cytochrome][cyp3a4] that metabolizes
aripiprazole so I was getting an effectively higher dose). But that was the most
productive week I'd had in ages. Suddenly, after _years_ of burnout, I had the
mental energy and motivation to _do things_. I resumed work on my [personal
projects][gh]. I stopped procrastinating. I was studying things that interest
me. I felt like the person I am.

[eps]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptoms
[cyp3a4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4
[gh]: https://github.com/eudoxia0

I told this to three psychiatrists but none of them seemed to think it was
meaningful. One of them offered to restart me on aripiprazole, but I didn't want
to risk [tardive dyskinesia][td]. So I went back to being a lazy bum.

[td]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia

Years later, while going down an autistic special interest rabbithole, I got
interested in pharmacology. I bought a copy of [_Molecular Neuropharmacology: A
Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience_][molneuro]. And I didn't read it (because
I didn't have the executive function) but I did leaf through it. And in the
first chapter I read about how [partial agonists][pagonist] work.

[molneuro]: https://neurology.mhmedical.com/book.aspx?bookID=2963
[pagonist]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist

Briefly: low dopamine activity makes you ADHD, high dopamine activity makes you
schizophrenic. That's why stimulants (which increase dopamine) can cause
psychosis. A partial agonist of dopamine acts as an [agonist][agon] (dopamine ↑) when
dopamine is low, but acts as an [antagonist][antagon] (dopamine ↓) when dopamine is
high. In short: partial agonists are [stabilizers][stab]. Aripiprazole is a partial
agonist of dopamine.

[agon]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist
[antagon]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist
[stab]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15982997/

And I had an epiphany. And I looked it up: can Aripiprazole be used to treat
ADHD? I found a [case report][case] report of a woman with ADHD who was treated
with aripiprazole, she reported exactly what I experienced, down to the daytime
sleepiness. I found a [clinical trial][trial] where aripiprazole was
successfully used for ADHD.

[case]: https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/11/3/439/761618
[trial]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18759644/

This was 2022. It took me four years to figure it out (it turns out it's hard to
solve problems when you keep getting distracted from them). But who can say
they've diagnosed themselves from first principles after an unusual reaction to
a drug?

I talked about it with friends who have ADHD. I showed my psychiatrist the
[Austral commit log][log]: tall, narrow peaks of hyperfocus separated by long
stretches of inactivity.

# What Didn't Work

I resent when people say to stop taking pills because the solution to [insert
mental health] problem is exercise. First, because I can outlift everyone who
tells me that, and secondly because I feel that it confuses cause and effect. If
someone has crippling depression, and they start a rigorous exercise routine,
that might just mean they've spontaneously entered remission. So if your anxiety
or whatever can be handled by exercise and drinking a mango smoothie: good for
you. Please don't tell me about it.

Here's the things that didn't help with my ADHD: todo lists, the [X
effect][xeffect], Vipassana meditation, lifting, cardio, methylated vitamin B12,
vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, keto, carnivore, vegetarian, generic talk
therapy. More generally: pharmacology is the only thing that's even changed
anything for me, and the "classical" or non-pharmacological approaches only
become useful _with_ pharmacological assistance.

[xeffect]: https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/

It was only after I started taking Bupropion that I was able to use a todo list
consistently, that I was able to make [spaced repetition][sr] into a daily
habit, that I was able to build up productive habits and practices.

[sr]: /article/effective-spaced-repetition

My mental model of this is: when your reward function is just $f(x) = 0$,
putting effort on a productive task gives you as much reward as putting no
effort at all, or procrastinating on some instant-gratification Skinner
box. Habit formation becomes impossible. You might manage to use a todo list
consistently for a week, or two weeks, but eventually something happens that
breaks that streak, and you find that despite repeated effort, you have not
formed a habit. The associations in your brain simply _are not there_.

Bupropion's effects are very muted---it is a _very_ mild stimulant---but it gave
me just enough of a bump to my reward function that I was able to start
consciously building good habits.

# Bupropion

[Bupropion][bup], also known as Wellbutrin, is an antidepressant. And an aid in
quitting smoking. And a treatment for ADHD.

[bup]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion

Chemically, it's a substituted amphetamine; in terms of its activity on
receptors it's an [NDRI][ndri], a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It
binds to [NET][net] and [DAT][dat], effectively increasing the activity of
norepinephine and dopamine. And for this reason, it has a mild stimulant effect.

[ndri]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor
[net]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_transporter
[dat]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter#cite_ref-3

In most jurisdictions Bupropion is less strictly controlled than stimulants (in
Mexico it's OTC), this is because the stimulant effect is very mild, and it's
not a euphoriant.

There are three formulations:

1. Immediate release (IR)
2. Sustained release (SR)
3. Extended release (XR or XL)

SR is typically two 150mg pills taken eight hours apart, XL is usually one 300mg
pill taken once daily. SR is safer than IR and XL is safer than SR, because the
more extended the release, the lower the peak concentration, and the effects of
Bupropion are proportional to its plasma concentration.

I suppose most doctors would prescribe the XL by default for this reason. In
Australia, however, SR is the only version available, so I had to take 300mg
twice daily. This isn't great more sleep (more on this later) but 300mg is more
effective than 150mg.

# Side Effects

Some side effects I experienced:

- **Rash:** this appears to be a common problem, judging from r/Bupropion search
  results. Within two weeks of taking Bupropion, I felt itchy and saw the skin
  around my neck was erythematous. It didn't feel life threatening but it did
  look consistent with an allergic reaction. So, acting on medical advice, I
  discontinued Bupropion, took desloratadine for a month, and then tried
  starting the Bupropion again. The rash didn't come back, so it couldn't have
  been an allergic reaction.
- **Appetite:** the first day I took it I forgot to eat until I almost went to
  bed. This went away within a few days. Bupropion is a known anorectic.
- **Insomnia:** this was strongest the first few days I took it (150mg once
  daily) and quickly subsided. But when I moved to taking it twice daily the
  insomnia became more of a problem. Because the spacing between the doses is so
  long (8h), I'd often forget to take the second dose on time, so I'd take it
  later, which means I'd go to sleep later, wake up later, take the next first
  dose later, and so it's a vicious cycle of sleep schedule drift.

There are known side effects which I did not experience but merit a mention:

- **Seizure:** the headlining risk of Bupropion is seizures. Bupropion lowers
  the seizure threshold, if you have a history of seizures, this is worth
  mentioning to the doctor. My read on this is that, early on, Bupropion was
  prescribed in much higher doses (500 or 600mg) and in immediate release
  formulations, which led to many instances of seizures. Nowadays dosage stops
  at 450mg/day, and is typically just 300mg/day, and overwhelmingly in the form
  of sustained release or extended release formulations, which have lower peak
  concentrations. So modern formulations and doses are much safer.
- **Worsening Depression:** some people report that Bupropion worsens their
  mood. I know at least two people who reported it made them feel more
  depressed.
- **Alcohol:** this is a known bad interaction with Bupropion since it further
  lowers the seizure threshold. I just avoided drnking.
