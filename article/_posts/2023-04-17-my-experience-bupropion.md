Let me prefix this by saying that none of this is medical advice, I'm just an
autistic man with a lot of free time. If you have mental health problems, for
the love of God just talk to a psychiatrist. I promise it's not bad. I am
extremely pro-psychiatry and I love the pharmaceutical industry. That aside,
let's begin.

# An Epiphany

I have a funny story of how I realized I have ADHD.

In late 2017 I started taking [fluvoxamine][flv] for anxiety. It helped, but
partially, so the psychiatrist added [aripiprazole][ari], an atypical
antipsychotic which is sometimes used as an [adjuvant][adj] to SSRIs.

[flv]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluvoxamine
[ari]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aripiprazole
[adj]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant

I had to quit after a week because I had [Parkinsonian tremors][eps] (it turns
out that fluvoxamine inhibits the [cytochrome][cyp3a4] that metabolizes
aripiprazole so I was getting an effectively higher dose). But that was the most
productive week I'd had in ages. Suddenly, after _years_ of burnout, I had the
mental energy and motivation to _do things_. I resumed work on my [personal
projects][gh]. I stopped procrastinating. I was studying things that interest
me. I felt like the person I am.

[eps]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptoms
[cyp3a4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4
[gh]: https://github.com/eudoxia0

I told this to three psychiatrists but none of them seemed to think it was
meaningful. One of them offered to restart me on aripiprazole, but I didn't want
to risk [tardive dyskinesia][td]. So I went back to being a lazy bum.

[td]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardive_dyskinesia

Years later, while going down an autistic special interest rabbithole, I got
interested in pharmacology. I bought a copy of [_Molecular Neuropharmacology: A
Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience_][molneuro]. And I didn't read it (because
I didn't have the executive function) but I did leaf through it. And in the
first chapter I read about how [partial agonists][pagonist] work.

[molneuro]: https://neurology.mhmedical.com/book.aspx?bookID=2963
[pagonist]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_agonist

Briefly: low dopamine activity makes you ADHD, high dopamine activity makes you
schizophrenic. That's why stimulants (which increase dopamine) can cause
psychosis. A partial agonist of dopamine acts as an [agonist][agon] (dopamine ↑) when
dopamine is low, but acts as an [antagonist][antagon] (dopamine ↓) when dopamine is
high. In short: partial agonists are [stabilizers][stab]. Aripiprazole is a partial
agonist of dopamine.

[agon]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist
[antagon]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_antagonist
[stab]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15982997/

And I had an epiphany. And I looked it up: can Aripiprazole be used to treat
ADHD? I found a [case report][case] report of a woman with ADHD who was treated
with aripiprazole, she reported exactly what I experienced, down to the daytime
sleepiness. I found a [clinical trial][trial] where aripiprazole was
successfully used for ADHD.

[case]: https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/11/3/439/761618
[trial]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18759644/

This was 2022. It took me four years to figure it out (it turns out it's hard to
solve problems when you keep getting distracted from them). But who can say
they've diagnosed themselves from first principles after an unusual reaction to
a drug?

I talked about it with friends who have ADHD. I showed my psychiatrist the
[Austral commit log][log]: tall, narrow peaks of hyperfocus separated by long
stretches of inactivity.

# Symptoms

1. **Autism:** obviously I have ASD (I told the psychiatrist who diagnosed me it
   would be more surprising if I didn't) and some 40% of autistic people have
   ADHD symptoms.

1. **Focus:** I never felt like I was particularly distractible or unfocused,
   mostly because I've unwittingly structured me life around not having to
   focus, using various coping skills, mostly centered around text.

   I've always struggled with paying attention during meetings, but I just
   thought that's because the meetings were pointless. I was very surprised
   when, after initiating Bupropion, I suddenly realized during a work meeting
   that I'd been paying attention for _multiple minutes_ on end without having
   to remember to take notes.

   I've tried meditation time and time again but I felt unable to make progress
   with it, because I'd lose focus within seconds. When I looked for advice on
   how to overcome this, people online would say: "just observe your
   thoughts". But the whole problem is that the thoughts surface on their own,
   and carry me away before I can notice them, and it's frustrating to resume
   meditating when you realize you've spent the past five minutes writing code
   in your head.

1. **Physical Restlessness:** my default mode of thinking is to pace the room
   endlessly, which I'd chalked up to [autistic stimming][pacing][^pacing]. When
   seated I'll drum my feet, if my legs are crossed I'll often shake the foot
   that's off the ground.

1. **Low Self-Control:** for years on end, every day I'd tell myself, "today
   we're going to sleep at a reasonable hour". The alarm would go off, and I'd
   find some excuse---I have to finish this Wikipedia rabbithole, or finish this
   video, or read one more paper---to stay up, and go to sleep somewhere between
   1 and 5 am. This was a big problem. Unfortunately the Bupropion doesn't
   exactly help here because the twice-daily dosing schedule gives me a bit of
   insomnia.

   Wikipedia in particular is like a time machine. I go to the front page,
   intending to look something up, click on the featured article---and come to
   forty five minutes later with twenty open tabs, somehow having gone from
   "[_Enceladus_][wiki1]" to "[_List of Allied bombings raids on Wilhelmshaven
   in World War II_][wiki1]". My life is like Memento: I wake up with no
   recollection of who I am but instead of tattoos I have all these PDFs I'll
   never read.

1. **Productivity:** [Austral][austral] took years to finish. Years. So much so
   that at a certain point I became embarrassed to bring it up, because I knew
   that when I did, people thought, "oh, yeah, that's Fernando's idée fixe that
   he keeps saying he'll finish". It took so long because I'd start working on
   it, and run out of steam, and leave it untouched for months and months on
   end.

   [_The Epiphany of Gliese 581_][eog581] is barely a novella at 26k words. It
   took me a year to finish. I worked on it by accumulating [fragments][frag]
   that came to me spontaneously, then growing text around them like geological
   strata, until the fragments began to touch in time. The idea of sitting down
   and writing it down, linearly, chapter by chapter and paragraph by paragraph
   was beyond ridiculous. I could hardly sit down to get three paragraphs out of
   my head at a time.

   Sometimes I'd get a burst of executive function, and I'd be able to work on a
   project consistently for a weekend or even a week or two. And I'd rack my
   brain to figure out: what did I do differently, and how do I extend this? Is
   it my diet? Have I accidentally fixed some persistent nutritional deficiency?
   Is it my caffeine dosing schedule? Should I do 150mg of caffeine in the
   morning and a cup of tea in the afternoon? What's the clearance rate of
   sugar-free Monster? Maybe I can supplement [L-tyrosine][tyr] since it's a
   dopamine precursor. I'd try to twist every knob: caffeine intake, sun
   exposure, cardio, lifting, etc. And nothing worked consistently.

   It made it extremely difficult to plan for the future, because I had no idea
   when or how long I could work on something.

1. **Chronic Underachievement:** I start an ambitious project, and it withers
   away. I dropped out of college. I start reading a book, put it away and
   forget it. The years pass, the projects remain unfinished. "I think I want to
   learn differential equations", I'll think. Three years pass, no
   progress. This is a great source of pain.

1. **Engineering Methodology:** I suppose this is somewhat self-serving, but the
   north star of all of my engineering work is complexity. I always insist on
   simplifying, keeping moving parts to a minimum, ensuring the whole system is
   small enough that it fits in my head so I can reason about it.

   I designed [Austral][austral] to be a programming language that I would enjoy
   using. Now I realize that the _entire_ language is designed as an assistive
   technology for a programmer with ADHD.

   The core language principle is simplicity. Everything is as explicit as
   possible, and implicit behaviour (like type conversions and exception
   propagation) are thrown out: this helps because everything you need to reason
   about the code is _right there on the page_. It places minimal demands on
   working memory. Writing code is, effectively, about serializing your working
   memory, and reading code is about restoring that serialization. If I get
   distracted, it doesn't matter, because I can just read the code again to
   restore context.

   There is a whole list of [_anti_-features][antifeatures], things I threw away
   explicitly to reduce cognitive overhead. The linear type system is designed
   to be based on a small core set of simple rules that [fit on a
   page][linearrules]. The module system, with the separation of module
   interfaces and bodies, is designed to minimize how much I have to read and
   hold in working memory in order to work. The language's features are designed
   to be overwhelmingly orthogonal. I threw out async because async + linear
   types is hard to reason about. I threw out exceptions because exceptions are
   hard to reason about.

# What Didn't Work

I resent when people say to stop taking pills because the solution to [insert
mental health] problem is exercise. First, because I can outlift everyone who
tells me that, and secondly because I feel that it confuses cause and effect. If
someone has crippling depression, and they start a rigorous exercise routine,
that might just mean they've spontaneously entered remission. So if your anxiety
or whatever can be handled by exercise and drinking a mango smoothie: good for
you. Please don't tell me about it.

Here's the things that didn't help with my ADHD: todo lists, the [X
effect][xeffect], Vipassana meditation, lifting, cardio, methylated vitamin B12,
vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, keto, carnivore, vegetarian, generic talk
therapy. More generally: pharmacology is the only thing that's even changed
anything for me, and the "classical" or non-pharmacological approaches only
become useful _with_ pharmacological assistance.

[xeffect]: https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/

It was only after I started taking Bupropion that I was able to use a todo list
consistently, that I was able to make [spaced repetition][sr] into a daily
habit, that I was able to build up productive habits and practices.

[sr]: /article/effective-spaced-repetition

My mental model of this is: when your reward function is just $f(x) = 0$,
putting effort on a productive task gives you as much reward as putting no
effort at all, or procrastinating on some instant-gratification Skinner
box. Habit formation becomes impossible. You might manage to use a todo list
consistently for a week, or two weeks, but eventually something happens that
breaks that streak, and you find that despite repeated effort, you have not
formed a habit. The associations in your brain simply _are not there_.

Bupropion's effects are very muted---it is a _very_ mild stimulant---but it gave
me just enough of a bump to my reward function that I was able to start
consciously building good habits.

# Bupropion

[Bupropion][bup], also known as Wellbutrin, is an antidepressant. And an aid in
quitting smoking. And a treatment for ADHD.

[bup]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion

Chemically, it's a substituted amphetamine; in terms of its activity on
receptors it's an [NDRI][ndri], a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It
binds to [NET][net] and [DAT][dat], effectively increasing the activity of
norepinephine and dopamine. And for this reason, it has a mild stimulant effect.

[ndri]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine%E2%80%93dopamine_reuptake_inhibitor
[net]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine_transporter
[dat]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_transporter#cite_ref-3

In most jurisdictions Bupropion is less strictly controlled than stimulants (in
Mexico it's OTC), this is because the stimulant effect is very mild, and it's
not a euphoriant.

There are three formulations:

1. Immediate release (IR)
2. Sustained release (SR)
3. Extended release (XR or XL)

SR is typically two 150mg pills taken eight hours apart, XL is usually one 300mg
pill taken once daily. SR is safer than IR and XL is safer than SR, because the
more extended the release, the lower the peak concentration, and the effects of
Bupropion are proportional to its plasma concentration.

I suppose most doctors would prescribe the XL by default for this reason. In
Australia, however, SR is the only version available, so I had to take 300mg
twice daily. This isn't great more sleep (more on this later) but 300mg is more
effective than 150mg.

# Effects

Since starting Bupropion I've observed the following positive changes:

1. **Anxiety:** it didn't eliminate anxiety, but it did reduce it by about
   20%-30%. This is surprising, since for some people Bupropion has the opposite
   effect and makes them more anxious.

1. **Intrusive Thoughts:** these were _vastly_ reduced, along with negative
   self-talk.

1. **Low Mood:** before starting Bupropion, I occasionally had days where I was
   in a very low mood. Since starting Bupropion, I've not had what I would call
   a bad day, where I feel terrible and just want to stay in bed. This is
   distinct from anxiety, which I still struggle with despite the Bupropion: I
   still have moments of blindingly acute anxiety, but not low mood or
   depression. Overall most of the time I feel optimistic.

1. **Productivity:** Bupropion increased my productivity by about 10%-30%. The
   effect is fairly muted: I don't _feel_ more energetic, but empirically I can
   look at my output and see that it has increased. Occasionally, I am able to
   dedicate an entire day to hyperfocusing on a problem, most of the time, the
   benefit is I can simply _start_ something and do a few hours of work.

   Bupropion gave me enough executive function to overcome the worst of ADHD and
   to allow me to"bootstrap" productivity. Since starting Bupropion, I:

   1. Started using a [todo list][todoist] daily and effectively.
   1. Became able to consciously form good habits, including doing [spaced
      repetition][sr] daily.
   1. Became much better at keeping on top of chores, including keeping the
      apartment clean.

   So it's not superhuman productivity, but I can make progress on projects and
   stay on top of chores. Doing creative work no longer feels like I'm in a
   hostage negotiation with my own brain.

   There are still things I procrastinate on. Correspondence is something I
   struggle a lot with, I'm ashamed to think of all the emails in my archive
   where people have reached out to me and I procrastinated on replying to them
   until it became too embarrassing to even reply apologetically.

   Interestingly the effects were not immediate, but gradual, since doubling to
   300mg daily I felt like productivity increasing like a gentle ramp-up across
   weeks and even months. It was like unlocking skills in a video game: I first
   unlocked the todo list, then the calendar, then the Pomodoro timer, etc.

1. **Anhedonia:** before Bupropion, I could easily experience negative emotion
   (mostly anxiety) but positive emotion was very muted. My emotional range
   topped out at "content". Formerly pleasurable activities such as reading,
   playing videogames, watching movies brought me little to now joy. With
   Bupropion I can enjoy things a bit more (even though all movies are bad).

1. **Accomplishments:** after years of on-and-off work, I managed to finish
   [Austral][introaustral][^finish]. After a year of struggling to put a single
   paragraph down on the page, I finished [_The Epiphany of Gliese
   581_][eog581]. It was still difficult, still time consuming, but I had enough
   help to manage. The work paid off. I felt that I succeeded, that my reward
   function was non-zero. I want to do more. I want to succeed more. Now I can.

# Side Effects

Some side effects I experienced:

- **Rash:** this appears to be a common problem, judging from r/Bupropion search
  results. Within two weeks of taking Bupropion, I felt itchy and saw the skin
  around my neck was erythematous. It didn't feel life threatening but it did
  look consistent with an allergic reaction. So, acting on medical advice, I
  discontinued Bupropion, took desloratadine for a month, and then tried
  starting the Bupropion again. The rash didn't come back, so it couldn't have
  been an allergic reaction.
- **Appetite:** the first day I took it I forgot to eat until I almost went to
  bed. This went away within a few days. Bupropion is a known anorectic.
- **Insomnia:** this was strongest the first few days I took it (150mg once
  daily) and quickly subsided. But when I moved to taking it twice daily the
  insomnia became more of a problem. Because the spacing between the doses is so
  long (8h), I'd often forget to take the second dose on time, so I'd take it
  later, which means I'd go to sleep later, wake up later, take the next first
  dose later, and so it's a vicious cycle of sleep schedule drift.

There are known side effects which I did not experience but merit a mention:

- **Seizure:** the headlining risk of Bupropion is seizures. Bupropion lowers
  the seizure threshold, if you have a history of seizures, this is worth
  mentioning to the doctor. My read on this is that, early on, Bupropion was
  prescribed in much higher doses (500 or 600mg) and in immediate release
  formulations, which led to many instances of seizures. Nowadays dosage stops
  at 450mg/day, and is typically just 300mg/day, and overwhelmingly in the form
  of sustained release or extended release formulations, which have lower peak
  concentrations. So modern formulations and doses are much safer.
- **Worsening Depression:** some people report that Bupropion worsens their
  mood. I know at least two people who reported it made them feel more
  depressed.
- **Alcohol:** this is a known bad interaction with Bupropion since it further
  lowers the seizure threshold. I just avoided drnking.
