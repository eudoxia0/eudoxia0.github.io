title: A Concise Introduction to GnuPG
---

[GNU Privacy Guard][gnupg], or GnuPG, is a cryptography tool. It lets you
encrypt and decrypt files, send and receive encrypted mail, and digitally sign
messages and verify message signatures. Despite its usefulness it's not widely
used: if you're on Linux you've likely typed a `gpg --recv-keys` command without
understanding what it does. It's reputed to be difficult to use correctly. So I
decided to sit down and learn it, and write down what I learned.
