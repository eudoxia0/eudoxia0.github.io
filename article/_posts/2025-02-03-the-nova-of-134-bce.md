title: The Nova of 134 BCE
---

A nova appeared in the sky in 134 BCE. This is attested by the court astronomers of [Han China][han]. It is possibly the same nova that, according to [Pliny], inspired [Hipparchus] to compile the first catalogue of stars.

# The Second Sun of Cicero

[Cicero], in [_De Natura Deorum_][denat], writes of the omens that cause men to believe in gods:

[denat]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Natura_Deorum

>[...] and the doubling of the sun, which my father told me had happened in the consulship of [Tuditanus][tud] and [Aquilius][aq], the year in which the light was quenched of [Publius Africanus][aem], that second sun of Rome [...] [^cic]

[aq]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manius_Aquillius_(129_BC)
[aem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipio_Aemilianus

"Publius Africanus" here is not [the elder][afri], but his adptive grandson, hereafter Scipio Aemilianus. He died in 129 BCE, the year of the consulship of Tuditanus and Aquilius. Cicero repeats the story in [_De Re Publica_][dere].

I found this intriguing. What was this phenomenon? Was it just a [sun dog][sundog], or could it have been a supernova? Searching for records of ancient supernovae, I found an interesting connection: Pliny wrote that Hipparchus, the Greek astronomer, was inspired to compile his catalogue of stars by the appearance of a "new star" in the sky. Hipparchus made his observations in Rhodes c. 129 BCE, the same year as the new sun of Cicero. So we have two observations of new stars, from around the same time.

# The Treatise on the Celestial Offices

In the [_Book of Han_][hanbuk]'s treatise on astronomy there is this line:

[hanbuk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Han

> 元光元年六月，客星見于房
>
> In the sixth month of the first year of Yuanguang, a guest star appeared in the Fang constellation.

Yuanguang (元光) is an [era] during the reign of the [Emperor Wu of Han][wu], the six-year period from 134 BCE to 129BCE. Fang (房) is one of the [lunar mansions][mansion], corresponding to the constellation [Scorpius].

[era]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_era_names
[wu]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Han
[mansion]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-Eight_Mansions
[Scorpius]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius

So, in 134 BCE there was a nova on Scorpius.

In the [_Records of the Grand Historian_][shiji] there is also a treatise on astronomy, which says:

[shiji]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiji

> 元光、元狩，蚩尤之旗再見，長則半天。
>
> During the Yuanguang and Yuanshou periods, [Chiyou]'s banner appeared again, stretching halfway across the sky.

[Chiyou]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiyou

Yuanshou (元狩) is the period from 122 BCE to 117 BCE. This appears to be describing a comet.

Also in the _Records of the Grand Historian_, we have the annals of the Wu Emperor, wherein it says:

> 其後三年，有司言元宜以天瑞命，不宜以一二數。一元曰建元，二元以長星曰元光，三元以郊得一角獸曰元狩云。
>
> Three years later, officials suggested that reign periods should be named after heavenly omens, and should not simply use numbers like 'first' and 'second'. The first reign period was called Jianyuan. The second reign period was called Yuanguang due to the appearance of a long star. The third reign period was called Yuanshou because a one-horned beast was encountered during the suburban sacrifice.

So the Yuanguang period was named after a nova. 元 means "first" or "primary", 光 means "light". A "long star" (長星) is obviously a comet.
