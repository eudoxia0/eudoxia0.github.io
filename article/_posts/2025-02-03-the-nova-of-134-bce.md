# The Second Sun of Cicero

[Cicero], in [_De Natura Deorum_][denat], writes of the omens that cause men to believe in gods:

>[...] and the doubling of the sun, which my father told me had happened in the consulship of [Tuditanus][tud] and [Aquilius][aq], the year in which the light was quenched of [Publius Africanus][aem], that second sun of Rome [...] [^cic]

"Publius Africanus" here is not [the elder][afri], but his adptive grandson, hereafter Scipio Aemilianus. He died in 129 BCE, the year of the consulship of Tuditanus and Aquilius. Cicero repeats the story in [_De Re Publica_][dere].
