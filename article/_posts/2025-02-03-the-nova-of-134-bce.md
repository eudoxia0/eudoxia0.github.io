title: The Nova of 134 BCE

A nova appeared in the sky in 134 BCE. This is attested by the court astronomers of [Han China][han]. It is possibly the same nova that, according to [Pliny], inspired [Hipparchus] to compile the first catalogue of stars.

# The Second Sun of Cicero

[Cicero], in [_De Natura Deorum_][denat], writes of the omens that cause men to believe in gods:

>[...] and the doubling of the sun, which my father told me had happened in the consulship of [Tuditanus][tud] and [Aquilius][aq], the year in which the light was quenched of [Publius Africanus][aem], that second sun of Rome [...] [^cic]

[aem]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scipio_Aemilianus

"Publius Africanus" here is not [the elder][afri], but his adptive grandson, hereafter Scipio Aemilianus. He died in 129 BCE, the year of the consulship of Tuditanus and Aquilius. Cicero repeats the story in [_De Re Publica_][dere].

I found this intriguing. What was this phenomenon? Was it just a [sun dog][sundog], or could it have been a supernova?
