<article>

[I write small libraries][libs]. If a project implements something that may
potentially be useful somewhere else, I'll factor it out.

I've written a lot of [Common Lisp][lisp] libraries. Other than libraries, I
mostly write compilers or small utilities.

# Austral

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

My current main project is the [Austral][austral] programming language: a
systems programming language with a linear type system. The language is designed
to be simple to understand and implement.

The key features are: memory safety, data race freedom, and capability-based security.

# Common Lisp Website

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

I built [a website](https://lisp-lang.org/) to promote Common Lisp, including a gallery of Lisp [success
stories][lisp-success], [a wiki][lisp-wiki], and [a tutorial][lisp-tutorial].

# Crane

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

Crane is an ORM for Common Lisp. It uses CLOS's amazing MetaObject
Protocol to map Common Lisp objects to SQL records and back, and
provides a [Django][django]-inspired simple interface and automatic
migrations.

Internally, Crane is very similar in structure to
[SQLAlchemy][sqlalchemy], only most of the components SQLAlchemy
implements internally are external libraries that Crane depends
on. Crane is built mostly on top of [fukamachiware][fukamachi]:
[cl-dbi][dbi] is used to provide a backend-agnostic database
abstraction, and [SxQL][sxql] is used as the DSL for generating SQL.

# cmacro

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

cmacro is like [sweet.js][sjs] for C. It implements a simple, pattern-matching
based macro language that can be used to extend C.

cmacro is written in Common Lisp, and is compiled to a native binary, so
you can drop it right into your Makefile between a file and clang
without changing anything.

The companion project, [Magma][magma], is a collection of cmacro extensions that
shows the scope of the macro system.

# Corona

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

Corona is basically a [Vagrant][vagrant] clone. You define virtual machines
(Their name, a base system to build from, amount of RAM, IP address, etc.) and
Corona sets it up. It uses VirtualBox to run the machines and [Vagrant
Cloud][vcloud] as a source of base images to build machines from.

The advantage it has over Vagrant is simply that it's pure Lisp, so it can be
used as a dependency in a Common Lisp system, without the user having to set up
the Ruby ecosystem to install Vagrant. It's also pretty nice to use.

# Rock

<div class="two-columns">
<div class="column">

Rock is an asset manager for Common Lisp, basically a combination of
[Bower][bower] plus an asset pipeline. It automatically downloads web
development libraries (JavaScript libraries like jQuery, JS/CSS libraries like
Bootstrap, etc.), manages their versions, and allows you to merge their files
together so you only serve a single CSS file and a single JS one.
